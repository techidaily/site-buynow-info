Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> There’s a lot to love about the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-quest-2-review-5092839" >Oculus Quest 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The standalone, wireless headset is easily the best VR experience for the majority of buyers, packing in solid power, a great screen, and quality games at the fantastic price of $299. But there are a couple of downgrades from the original, pricier Oculus Quest model, and the flimsy strap is chief among them.</p><p> While certainly usable, the Quest 2’s included fabric strap isn’t particularly effective at keeping the headset firmly and comfortably positioned on your face. Luckily, Quest 2 owners have another option if they’re willing to spend extra cash: the official Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap.</p><p> Available on its own for $49 or with a battery pack and carrying case for $129, the Elite Strap is a major improvement and worthwhile pickup for anyone who doesn’t love the original fit. I tested the latter configuration with the integrated battery pack and included case.</p><h2 id="Design-A-more-supportive-strap"><a href="#Design-A-more-supportive-strap" class="headerlink" title="Design: A more supportive strap"></a>Design: A more supportive strap</h2><p> While the standard Oculus Quest 2 strap is simply made up of fabric bands—one around the back of your head and the other over the top—the Elite Strap is mostly plastic and significantly more supportive. That’s because it helps offset the weight of the visor itself by using the back of your head to securely keep the entire headset in place, thus minimizing its ability to sag or feel heavy on your face.</p><p> The Elite Strap does this by having a soft plastic, oval-like brace at the back, which gently presses against the back of your head. It’s supported in part by a single fabric strap on the top, but more crucially by a locking mechanism on the back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/g-QXyXCZitYdlr7F5TWDuzllhuY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus_Quest_2_Elite_Strap_02-83833091dfde4b3b9e2253177901bb66.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap With Battery and Carrying Case"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Unlike the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-vr-4157636" >PlayStation VR’s strap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , for example, the Quest 2 Elite Strap’s fit wheel doesn’t lock into place and make you press a button to release it from your head when you want out. Instead, you can gradually adjust it until the headset feels snug but comfortable, and freely tighten or loosen it as needed. It stays put.</p><p> It’s a big upgrade over the normal Quest 2 strap. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-quest-review-4692669" >original Quest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> had a simple plastic strap, but it was a step up from what Oculus shipped with the sequel. The Elite Strap represents an improvement upon both standard designs, and it’s one of the best VR headset straps around. It’s secure, easy to use, and comfortable, checking every box on the list.</p><p> The Elite Strap is a major improvement and worthwhile pickup for anyone who doesn’t love the original strap’s fit.</p><p> This particular Elite Strap model has a battery pack built into the back part of the strap, within the plastic housing. It doesn’t feel heavy or noticeable, although there must be a weight difference between this version and the standalone, battery-less Elite Strap option.</p><p> Meanwhile, the included carrying case in this bundle is large enough to fit the entire headset with the Elite Strap, as well as the two Oculus Touch controllers and the charger. The large pill-shaped design is non-traditional for a gadget case, looking like light grey sweatpants and with a wool-like felt texture. The case can be a little awkward to unzip, but it’s functional and roomy enough to hold everything, even if it doesn’t look nearly as cool as what it holds.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Snap-it-on"><a href="#Setup-Process-Snap-it-on" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Snap it on"></a>Setup Process: Snap it on</h2><p> Oculus built in a clever strap support system with the Quest 2 that lets you securely and seamlessly attach different kinds of straps. When you remove the standard strap, you’ll be left with these plastic “wings” on either side of the visor, and those snap right into the Elite Strap’s plastic bands to firmly attach it to the visor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kePEj93uGIlmO7iyZMsHMaUpHEE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus_Quest_2_Elite_Strap_03-4d5ab74d783144e0aee262248d5cdb89.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap With Battery and Carrying Case"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Once it’s secured, simply plug the USB-C cable on the side of the Elite Strap into the Quest 2 visor, as this adds power from the battery pack into your total supply. Now you’ll charge the entire headset via the USB-C port beneath the dial on the Elite Strap, which provides power to both the visor and strap batteries.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094477/7443" target="_top" id="2094477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094477/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Effective-and-adjustable"><a href="#Comfort-Effective-and-adjustable" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Effective and adjustable"></a>Comfort: Effective and adjustable</h2><p> Comfort is one of the driving forces behind the creation of the Elite Strap, and a major reason anyone would consider paying $49 or more for a different strap. Some people might find the Oculus Quest 2’s strap to be perfectly fine, but in my own testing, it was just tolerable: The headset felt heavy and was never as securely fastened in place as I wanted it to be. It was a big step down from the original Quest’s solid, rubberized plastic strap.</p><p> [The strap] helps take away some of the friction that bad straps can create, letting you sink further into the immersive illusion.</p><p> The Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap fixes that issue for me, and I can’t imagine anyone will find it to be less comfortable than the standard strap. It’s a clever design that pulls inspiration from previous VR headsets to ably support the weight of the visor, while still allowing for subtle adjustments without needing to take the headset off your dome. It feels great in use, and more importantly, it helps take away some of the friction that bad straps can create, letting you sink further into the immersive illusion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/v5qFVd_vGEfVkRoTgyxHCnpNO7Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus_Quest_2_Elite_Strap_04-6b671f2308db4225b4f355d0abd12f2d.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap With Battery and Carrying Case"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144271/7443" target="_top" id="2144271">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144271" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144271/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Double-the-uptime"><a href="#Battery-Double-the-uptime" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Double the uptime"></a>Battery: Double the uptime</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2’s built-in battery lasts only about two hours, and the Elite Strap’s secondary 4,676mAh pack effectively doubles that tally. It adds roughly two more hours of use, meaning you’ll have the freedom to play for much longer sessions and&#x2F;or charge the headset less often.</p><p> I haven’t personally had any issue with the Quest 2’s modest battery, as I rarely play VR for more than an hour at a time. However, as more immersive games are released, as people use VR for social interactions, and as you might spend more time watching idle content (like movies) in a virtual reality setting, that extra buffer could come in handy. The Quest 2 sips power from the Elite Strap’s battery first, and as previously mentioned, one USB-C plug charges the whole thing.</p><p> The battery pack adds roughly two more hours of use, meaning you’ll have the freedom to play for much longer sessions and&#x2F;or charge the headset less often.</p><p> Granted, there are DIY options out there for boosting the Quest 2’s battery life, including plugging in a portable power bank and either sticking it into your pocket or otherwise affixing it to your body or headset. Depending on the size of the power bank, you could get significantly more uptime from that kind of solution and at a lower cost—but that’s more hassle and it’s a less elegant solution than the official option here.</p><h2 id="Price-Not-cheap-but-it’s-worth-it"><a href="#Price-Not-cheap-but-it’s-worth-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not cheap, but it’s worth it"></a>Price: Not cheap, but it’s worth it</h2><p> After spending $299 on a VR headset, some might bristle at spending another $49 for a different strap—or $129 for that strap, double the battery life, and a case. However, if the Quest 2’s standard strap isn’t meeting your needs, then the Elite Strap is well worth the extra cash.</p><p> It eliminates one of the common pain points of the Quest 2 experience, letting you focus more on the VR experience rather than how you’re accessing it. The Quest 2 is already incredibly well-priced for a standalone VR console, and still feels like a great value even if you factor in another $49 for the Elite Strap.</p><p> Do you need the whole bundle with the battery pack and case, though? If you typically use the Quest 2 in short sessions and don’t mind plugging it in on a regular basis, then probably not. The battery_can_ be a major benefit, particularly if you find yourself sticking around in VR for longer time spans, but that’s not always the case for users. The Elite Strap, in my view, provides the greatest enhancement within this bundle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/edSGh2YZZ5OIkwkHbEJnwtUjfGc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus_Quest_2_Elite_Strap_05-e018715e02944614b51af8a2cb98f055.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap With Battery and Carrying Case"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100526/7443" target="_top" id="2100526">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100526" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> The case is nice to have, and given that the original official Oculus Quest case sold for $40 on its own, this bundle doesn’t feel overpriced by comparison. Buying the Oculus Quest 2 headset plus this bundle comes out to nearly the same price as buying the original Quest headset ($399) plus its carrying case back when, but now you get double the battery life along with the myriad enhancements of the core Quest 2 hardware.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977032">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977032">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977032%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977032/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Oculus-Quest-2-Elite-Strap-vs-Orzero-Adjustable-Headband-for-Quest-2"><a href="#Oculus-Quest-2-Elite-Strap-vs-Orzero-Adjustable-Headband-for-Quest-2" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap vs. Orzero Adjustable Headband for Quest 2"></a>Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap vs. Orzero Adjustable Headband for Quest 2</h2><p> There’s a number of third-party straps for the Quest 2 out there, no doubt encouraged by the severe supply shortage of the Elite Strap following its release. Orzero’s Adjustable Headband for Oculus Quest 2 (view at<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MFH6V6C/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5193587%7Cn10531399cf62445bbb649a7878d1155511%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a well-reviewed alternative that’s a bit different in look, thanks to a much larger plastic shell on the back of your head, but it appears to work similarly to the official Elite Strap. It’s $10 cheaper than the official option, so it could be a good substitute or cheaper alternative. There is no version with a built-in battery pack, however.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A truly Elite addition to the Quest 2.</strong></p><p> If your Oculus Quest 2 doesn’t quite fit right, pick up the Elite Strap. It’s a much better-designed strap that securely and comfortably keeps the VR headset in place during use, and is well worth the extra cash. True, you might grimace at the thought of spending more money on something that should’ve come with the standard headset, but the improved experience should ultimately outweigh that frustration. The bundle with the battery pack and carrying case adds further value and is worthwhile if you’re keen on longer play sessions or not needing to charge the headset as often, but the Elite Strap itself is the most essential add-on in this set.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-quest-2-review-5092839" >Oculus Quest 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-rift-review-4690370" >Oculus Rift Headset and Controllers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-go-vr-headset-review-4690298" >Oculus Go Standalone VR Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Quest 2 Elite Strap with Battery and Carrying Case</li><li>Product Brand  Oculus</li><li>UPC  815820021056</li><li>Price  $129.00</li><li>Release Date  September 2020</li><li>Weight  11.36 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  13 x 6.75 x 4.5 in.</li><li>Color  White&#x2F;Black</li><li>Ports  USB-C</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-digital-renaissance-evolving-your-vintage-photographs-into-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Digital Renaissance Evolving Your Vintage Photographs Into Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/4-ways-to-transfer-music-from-apple-iphone-12-to-ipod-touch-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>4 Ways to Transfer Music from Apple iPhone 12 to iPod touch | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/6-ways-to-change-spotify-location-on-your-oppo-reno-11-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/amazon-echo-show-10-gen-3-a-comprehensive-overview-and-mobility-features/"><u>Amazon Echo Show 10 (Gen 3): A Comprehensive Overview and Mobility Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-evaluation-of-lg-stylo-nv-where-elegance-meets-precision-with-the-stylus-feature/"><u>Comprehensive Evaluation of LG Stylo Nv: Where Elegance Meets Precision with the Stylus Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/getting-sound-back-in-your-hp-laptop-quick-fixes-and-expert-tips/"><u>Getting Sound Back in Your HP Laptop - Quick Fixes and Expert Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/guide-to-cost-free-text-animations-onlineoff-for-2024/"><u>Guide to Cost-Free Text Animations (Online/Off) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/lenovo-ideapad-3-slim-laptop-evaluation-your-ultra-portable-tech-companion/"><u>Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Slim Laptop Evaluation: Your Ultra-Portable Tech Companion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/skyrim-on-nintendo-switch-a-comprehensive-guide-and-gaming-experience/"><u>Skyrim on Nintendo Switch: A Comprehensive Guide and Gaming Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-caixuns-75-inch-android-tv-with-4k-clarity-on-a-shoestring-budget/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Caixun's 75-Inch Android TV with 4K Clarity on a Shoestring Budget</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/unlocking-private-chats-new-end-to-end-encryption-rollout-by-facebook-for-direct-and-call-services/"><u>Unlocking Private Chats: New End-to-End Encryption Rollout by Facebook for Direct & Call Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/video-cataloging-mastery-perfecting-playlists-on-youtube-platform/"><u>Video Cataloging Mastery Perfecting Playlists on YouTube Platform</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black is the result of multiple refinements since the original model, and through its many iterations, it’s become one of the most popular and high-tech action cameras on the market. From insanely advanced image stabilization to live streaming capabilities, the HERO7 Black is built for more than just action shots.</p><p> We recently got our hands on this tiny powerhouse to see if the improvements in software and video quality are worth its asking price.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Design-Classic-action-camera-design"><a href="#Design-Classic-action-camera-design" class="headerlink" title="Design: Classic action camera design"></a><strong>Design: Classic action camera design</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black measures in at 2.4 x 1.3 x 1.8 inches, so it’s super compact and almost a cube. The device is all black with a very nice rubber casing around the unit that makes it feel soft to the touch.</p><p> The design is very minimal. The power button is located on the right side of the camera and a record button at the top. On the side, there is a door that hides the USB and HDMI ports, and another door on the bottom that conceals the battery and MicroSD port. The front of the camera has a small screen that displays the current settings.</p><p> All these doors protect the camera’s ports from the elements and give it a tough outer shell that’s rugged enough to survive rough falls and submersion in up to 33 feet of water. The HERO7 Black is a great travel camera that can be taken on exotic trips where water adventures and rough terrain are a part of your itinerary.</p><p> While testing the GoPro HERO7 Black we noticed that the body of the device becomes very hot when used for long periods of time. We tested it for a few hours nonstop and noticed it was still very warm even when it was not recording. This can be a big concern if the device is used for long recordings in hot temperatures.</p><h2 id="Display-Bright-and-visible"><a href="#Display-Bright-and-visible" class="headerlink" title="Display: Bright and visible"></a><strong>Display: Bright and visible</strong></h2><p> The back of the GoPro HERO7 Black has a two-inch touchscreen that is bright and easy to read. While testing the camera, we were able to navigate through the menus with the single touch of a finger, which are intuitive and easy to adjust. Simply tap to select.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Setup-Updates-out-of-the-box"><a href="#Setup-Updates-out-of-the-box" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Updates out of the box"></a><strong>Setup: Updates out of the box</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black did not have much battery life out of the box. Once we powered it on, we set the date, time, and location. It then prompted us to update the software, which required a blank memory card and fully-charged battery to complete.</p><p> The HERO7 Black has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth compatibility, which makes it easy to pair with a smartphone that has the GoPro App downloaded. We were able to make the camera discoverable in the Preferences menu, and then the app could automatically scan and connect to the camera when it was opened.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Sensor-Small-but-mighty"><a href="#Sensor-Small-but-mighty" class="headerlink" title="Sensor: Small but mighty"></a><strong>Sensor: Small but mighty</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black boasts a 1&#x2F;2.3-inch 12-megapixel sensor that is built for action. The new and improved image processor now has the ability to stabilize footage through electronic image stabilization technology called HyperSmooth. This feature works by tracking unwanted motion in your videos and algorithmically correcting shake. It makes your footage impressively stable even when filming handheld or while riding on rough terrain.</p><p> We took the GoPro out and recorded some handheld video as we walked around, which would normally have some shake to it. The footage from the HERO7 Black was smooth and it did not contain any camera shake, almost as if we’d been using a gimbal.</p><p> It makes your footage impressively stable even when filming handheld or while riding on rough terrain.</p><h2 id="Lens-Great-for-video"><a href="#Lens-Great-for-video" class="headerlink" title="Lens: Great for video"></a><strong>Lens: Great for video</strong></h2><p> The fixed lens on the GoPro HERO7 Black shoots wide or in SuperView mode, the latter of which is an extra-wide field of view and can sometimes give a kind of distorted fisheye effect to your footage. This distortion can be frustrating, but there are ways to work around it during editing, including using video editing software to correct. And when shooting at a lower resolution, the camera can shoot with a linear field of view which reduces the distortion of the lens. The SuperView is not available when shooting in a 4:3 aspect ratio.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137204/26400" target="_top" id="2137204">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137204" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137204/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Video-Quality-Amazing-4K-quality-with-variable-frame-rates"><a href="#Video-Quality-Amazing-4K-quality-with-variable-frame-rates" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality: Amazing 4K quality with variable frame rates"></a><strong>Video Quality: Amazing 4K quality with variable frame rates</strong></h2><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> quality of the GoPro HERO7 Black is gorgeous. Content creators and travel vloggers will absolutely appreciate this camera’s recording capabilities.</p><p> While testing the GoPro HERO7 Black, the 4K video looked its best when recording in bright lighting conditions. In lower light, the quality began to degrade and grain started to form in the shadow areas of the scene.</p><p> New to the GoPro HERO7 is the ability to create a TimeWarp video. This feature allows the user to create super smooth time-lapse videos with HyperSmooth technology, so the camera doesn’t have to be stationary. This opens up the ability to be more creative when making time lapse videos.</p><p> The ability to capture 1080p video at 240fps is also a game-changer. The slow-motion feature of this camera is stunning, producing beautiful smooth footage, especially when used in bright lighting conditions. If you’re an athlete looking to record and analyze footage of yourself, the HERO7 Black gives you a great way to slow down footage and study movement.</p><p> The GoPro HERO7 also has a live stream feature. Using the GoPro app, you can set up a live video feed by connecting to your Facebook, YouTube, and various other social media networks. Once connected to the desired account, you will be able to go live within minutes.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144275/7443" target="_top" id="2144275">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144275" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144275/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Photo-Quality-Nothing-to-brag-about"><a href="#Photo-Quality-Nothing-to-brag-about" class="headerlink" title="Photo Quality: Nothing to brag about"></a><strong>Photo Quality: Nothing to brag about</strong></h2><p> The photo quality on the GoPro HERO7 Black is average, though it does have the ability to create HDR (High Dynamic Range) images.</p><p> Due to the lens distortion, the images that this camera produces have a specific look that you may either love or hate. It also has a fixed lens that does not zoom, so that limits its functionality compared to typical point-and-shoot cameras.</p><p> But generally speaking, the GoPro HERO7 Black is not a camera known for its stunning photographs—it is known for its stunning video capabilities. It’s not for someone that wants to use it specifically for still photographs.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Sensitive-to-the-touch"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Sensitive-to-the-touch" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Sensitive to the touch"></a><strong>Sound Quality: Sensitive to the touch</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black’s microphones are sensitive and record ambient noise easily. The microphones are located on the body of the camera and any slight touch becomes audible in your video. When taking some handheld footage, we accidentally covered up the microphones with our fingers, which caused the audio to sound muffled in our video.</p><p> The ability to add external microphones turns the GoPro HERO7 Black from an action camera to a high-quality video camera.</p><p> The internal microphones are useful if the sound is not a priority in your videos, but if great audio is a necessity, it is best to invest in an external microphone. You can connect one to the HERO7 Black through the USB connection, which opens up possibilities for external microphones, lapel mics, and digital audio recorders to enhance sound recording capabilities.</p><p> The ability to add external microphones turns the GoPro HERO7 Black from an action camera to a high-quality video camera. Pairing the 4K resolution with great audio quality, this camera becomes a powerful tool in the hands of the right content creator.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Speedy-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-pairing"><a href="#Connectivity-Speedy-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-pairing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Speedy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth pairing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Speedy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth pairing</strong></h2><p> Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze with the GoPro HERO7 Black. Once we installed the GoPro app on our smartphone, the camera connected instantly. The app also gave us a much larger and easier-to-read interface, plus a live view function that allowed us to use our phone to frame and compose videos and remotely control the camera.</p><p> Inside the app, there are also options to edit mode settings, change the original set up, review camera info, changed Wi-Fi remotes, as well as monitor the battery level and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-format-sd-card-camera-4587017" >SD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> capacity. It also makes it easier to review footage and images that the camera captures.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139111/17108" target="_top" id="2139111">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139111" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139111/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Life-High-res-video-drains-it-quickly"><a href="#Battery-Life-High-res-video-drains-it-quickly" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: High-res video drains it quickly"></a><strong>Battery Life: High-res video drains it quickly</strong></h2><p> When recording 4K video at 60 fps, the HERO7 Black’s battery only lasts about 50 minutes, so if you’re going to be shooting all day, it would be smart to have a few extra batteries available.</p><p> Another option to extend shooting time would be to connect the GoPro HERO7 Black to an external battery pack via the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972670/19272" target="_top" id="1972670">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972670" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972670/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Fairly-priced-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Fairly-priced-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Fairly priced for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Fairly priced for what you get</strong></h2><p> Retailing for $400 but often selling for less, the GoPro HERO7 Black is reasonably priced for its amazing features. 4K recording, HyperSmooth image stabilization, high frame rates, Bluetooth connectivity, a waterproof body, and live streaming features make this camera well worth the asking price.</p><p> Perfect for adventurers, filmmakers, and vloggers that need a rugged and compact camera to create content on the go.</p><p> The portability of the GoPro HERO7 Black is perfect for adventurers, filmmakers, and vloggers that need a rugged and compact camera to create content on the go.</p><h2 id="Competition-Less-rugged-but-better-with-still-photography"><a href="#Competition-Less-rugged-but-better-with-still-photography" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Less rugged, but better with still photography"></a><strong>Competition: Less rugged, but better with still photography</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II:</em></strong> The Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II retails for $700, and though it usually sells for between $600 and $650, it’s still considerably more expensive than the GoPro HERO7 Black. For those who are considering the GoPro as a vlogging camera, the PowerShot is another great option. It records video at 1080p rather than 4K, but it has a larger 20.3-megapixel sensor and a 180-degree articulating LCD touchscreen display that’s perfect for self-recording.</p><p> The Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II utilizes an advanced DIGIC 7 Image Processor, which creates better photographs than the GoPro HERO7 Black. This image processor also provides better video stabilization and autofocusing for video, though it’s admittedly not as advanced as the GoPro’s HyperSmooth feature.</p><p> Comparing this to the GoPro HERO7 Black, the Canon is much more user-friendly. It’s a better fit for those that want a versatile camera that they can grab and use easily, without having to maneuver through menus on a tiny screen.</p><p><strong><em>Canon PowerShot SX740 HS:</em></strong> Retailing for $400, the Canon PowerShot SX740 HS is right on par price-wise with the GoPro HERO7 Black. The PowerShot is also capable of recording 4K video, but it lacks the frame rates that the GoPro HERO7 Black is capable of. It’s also capable of capturing photos without distortion, which makes it a more versatile camera.</p><p> The PowerShot SX740 HS is geared toward someone that wants a little bit of everything. It can shoot 4K and take photographs, but it doesn’t quite live up to the excellent video quality of the GoPro. The PowerShot is also a more user-friendly device that is suited for people familiar with standard point-and-shoot cameras.</p><p> The camera also has a 180-degree adjustable LCD screen, which makes it an even more powerful tool for vloggers.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/canon-powershot-sx740-hs-review-4705542" >Canon PowerShot SX740 HS Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A rugged and compact action camera with fantastic video stabilization.</strong></p><p> Between the amazing video quality and the enhanced HyperSmooth electronic image stabilization, the GoPro HERO7 Black is perfect for adventurers who want to record or even live-stream their most rugged expeditions. It produces beautiful videos with enhanced color and sharpness and is small enough to wear or mount somewhere without it getting in the way.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/akaso-ek7000-pro-4k-action-camera-review-4770265" >AKASO EK7000 Pro 4K Action Camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-ii-review-4706895" >Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-dsc-w800-review-4589510" >Sony DSC-W800 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136613/26400" target="_top" id="2136613">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136613" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136613/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  HERO7 Black</li><li>Product Brand  GoPro</li><li>MPN  CHDHX-701</li><li>Price  $399.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  2.4 x 1.3 x 1.8 in.</li><li>Sensor  12MP, 1-Chip CMOS</li><li>Video  Up to 4K at 60 fps, or 1080p at 240 fps</li><li>Audio Format  WAV</li><li>Photo ISO Range  100 - 3200 (Auto)</li><li>Burst Photos  30 photos&#x2F;sec</li><li>Output  1 x micro-HDMI (Type D)</li><li>Video ISO Range  100 - 6400 (Auto)</li><li>Input  1 x USB 3.0</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-the-animators-odyssey-crafting-your-own-fx-realm/"><u>[Updated] The Animator's Odyssey Crafting Your Own FX Realm</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-affordable-free-screen-capture/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Affordable, Free Screen Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-classical-works-free-for-all/"><u>Exploring Classical Works Free for All</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-perform-hard-reset-on-infinix-hot-30i-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How to Perform Hard Reset on Infinix Hot 30i?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus is an interesting proposition. For only $50, it promises to provide heart rate monitoring, music storage, call management, voice control, and remote notifications. For the most part, it delivers. The Bitwatch has its share of design flaws, such as a poorly fitted watch strap and an iOS-only voice app, but it performs enough to be a reasonable consideration for those looking for their first smartwatch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8rMhc1Lk5yFRFW4Zlt2K9cmPdFo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4157747-4-01d7e5ff51aa47008d803513064f4a7a.jpg"                      alt="Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus Smartwatch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Design-and-Software-A-surprising-amount-of-features-in-this-chunky-watch"><a href="#Design-and-Software-A-surprising-amount-of-features-in-this-chunky-watch" class="headerlink" title="Design and Software: A surprising amount of features in this chunky watch"></a><strong>Design and Software: A surprising amount of features in this chunky watch</strong></h2><p> The most outstanding feature of the Bitwatch’s design is its chunkiness. For those with small wrists, this smartwatch looks ridiculous. Furthermore, the included bands are too small in comparison to the watch, giving the overall design a cheap feel. When you wear this watch, you will notice it weighing your wrists down, taunting you to take it off. But as ugly as the Bitwatch is, it is a functional little watch. It has a power button and volume buttons, as well as a strong vibration motor. Its touchscreen works without a problem, and the app layout is intuitive to understand.</p><p> The 2-inch IPS panel is bright and easy to read, although not the highest resolution (240 x 240). When you scroll through the Bitwatch’s apps, it’s apparent that it heavily favors Apple devices: there is a Siri app integration, but this will not work with Android devices. Its other apps are a phonebook, call log, dialer, messaging, remote notifier, “anti-theft” (Find My Phone), alarm, calendar, music storage and playback, remote capture, pedometer, sleep monitor, sedentary reminder, heart rate monitor, sound recorder, stopwatch, and calculator. It’s a fairly thorough collection of applications for a watch that doesn’t support third-party apps.</p><p> The 2-inch IPS panel is bright and easy to read, although not the highest resolution (240 x 240).</p><p> While it doesn’t have<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nfc-832715" >NFC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or GPS, it does have a speaker, and you can send basic messages with the watch. The Bitwatch S1 is surprisingly robust for those who want to dip their toes into the smartwatch experience, with many of the features that mid-tier smartwatches possess.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137212/26400" target="_top" id="2137212">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137212" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137212/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-but-unexplained"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-but-unexplained" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy, but unexplained"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy, but unexplained</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Bitwatch works as you’d expect. Pair it via the Bluetooth on your phone and download the Beantech app. It works with both Android and iOS, so you should have no difficulty. Alerts will show up in the remote notifier app, and apps such as the calendar are not synced with your phone’s calendar apps, so keep that in mind if you’d like to add any events, notifications, or alarms to your watch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O7xHfA9sKsBdC0nmqNXbFky-Dm4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4157747-2-3b838f1124184bbd9452b79bb8449c2b.jpg"                      alt="Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus Smartwatch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037351/7443" target="_top" id="2037351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037351/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036481/19272" target="_top" id="2036481">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036481" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036481/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-You-get-what-you-pay-for"><a href="#Performance-You-get-what-you-pay-for" class="headerlink" title="Performance: You get what you pay for"></a><strong>Performance: You get what you pay for</strong></h2><p> The Bitwatch’s low price tag shows in its performance, unfortunately. The Siri app is just that: it interfaces with Siri, meaning that voice commands are iOS-exclusive. Notification handling on the device can get confusing also. You find notifications in the Remote Notifier app, and dismissing them on the Bitwatch does not dismiss them on your phone.</p><p> You get reliable notifications and a passable heart rate monitor, as well as some basic functions like alarms and a speaker.</p><p> However, notifications do sync almost instantly from your phone to the Bitwatch, and its heart rate monitor is fairly accurate when measuring a resting heart rate. The pedometer isn’t the best thought, often falling within a range of a hundred steps of the true value.</p><p> If you’d like to listen to calls or music through the speaker, you will miss a lot of information— think of those jingles they play when you’re on hold for a phone call. At least the screen is big and easy to read, and the notifications_do_ work. It’s good enough for someone that wants to get a feel to a smartwatch experience, but there are better options for a little more money if you can afford it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7GtX2IU-w4sJA-BTqQtHQThxaJo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4157747-3-ade31135cd9d4fe0b6b01286941d2652.jpg"                      alt="Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus Smartwatch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Battery-It-last-longer-than-most-flagship-smartwatches"><a href="#Battery-It-last-longer-than-most-flagship-smartwatches" class="headerlink" title="Battery: It last longer than most flagship smartwatches"></a><strong>Battery: It last longer than most flagship smartwatches</strong></h2><p> The battery life on the Bitwatch is excellent. With regular usage (GPS, heart rate, Bluetooth all on), we got between two and three days of use before we had to recharge. Charging is a little annoying, though, since it uses a snapping charger base that’s difficult to remove.</p><h2 id="Price-Reasonable-but-worth-paying-more"><a href="#Price-Reasonable-but-worth-paying-more" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable, but worth paying more"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable, but worth paying more</strong></h2><p> The Bitwatch costs about $50, which is reasonable for its features and performance. You get reliable notifications and a passable heart rate monitor, as well as some basic functions like alarms and a speaker. If you want a cheap smartwatch, then the Bitwatch isn’t a bad pick, but $30 more can get you GPS and smarter notifications.

However, it suffers in reliability and style, which may turn users off from the smartwatch market altogether. For a little more money, you can get the Amazfit Bip_,_ a sleek smartwatch from Huami that has a thirty-day battery life, fitness tracking, onboard GPS, and notifications. If you’re looking to get something very cheap to try out the smartwatch lifestyle, you should also look at the Padgene DZ09 Smart Watch, which is only $15 and has a lot of the features on the Bitwatch.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazfit-bip-review-4773112" >Amazfit Bip Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An ultra-budget smartwatch that covers the basics.</strong></p><p> The Beantech Bitwatch is not a groundbreaking smartwatch, but it provides a lot of essential features for $50. If you’re looking to try out smartwatches, the Bitwatch will give you a solid battery life, music storage, passive notifications, phone call management, and a very large touchscreen.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Bitwatch S1 Plus</li><li>Product Brand  Beantech</li><li>MPN  B071VZMBH9</li><li>Price  $59.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.97 x 1.61 x 0.54 in.</li><li>Compatibility  iOS, Android</li><li>Platform  Bitwatch App</li><li>Storage  8GB</li><li>Camera  Yes</li><li>Battery Capacity  Unknown; 2 days in field testing</li><li>Waterproof  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-a-closer-look-at-stale-vr-landscapes-what-changes/"><u>[New] In 2024, A Closer Look at Stale VR Landscapes What Changes?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-amassing-audiences-and-assets-launching-a-livestream-business-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Amassing Audiences and Assets Launching a Livestream Business for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/asuss-latest-masterpiece-for-gamers-the-rapture-gt-ax11000-router-a-detailed-breakdown-of-speed-and-features/"><u>ASUS's Latest Masterpiece for Gamers - The Rapture GT-AX11000 Router: A Detailed Breakdown of Speed and Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/best-10-mock-location-apps-worth-trying-on-vivo-v29-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Best 10 Mock Location Apps Worth Trying On Vivo V29 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/contrasting-iphone-15-pro-max-and-samsung-s2e-ultra-a-detailed-breakdown-of-their-unique-features/"><u>Contrasting iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung S2e Ultra - A Detailed Breakdown of Their Unique Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/demystifying-the-value-of-apples-vision-pro-investment/"><u>Demystifying the Value of Apple's Vision Pro Investment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/dont-skip-the-savings-commit-to-regular-windows-backup/"><u>Don't Skip the Savings: Commit to Regular Windows Backup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/exploring-the-features-of-the-netgear-c3cable-modemrouter-duo-time-for-an-update/"><u>Exploring the Features of the Netgear C3Cable Modem/Router Duo – Time for an Update?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/game-changing-console-or-not-discover-why-the-ps5-is-worth-it/"><u>Game-Changing Console or Not?

Since the brand’s rebirth at the hands of HMD Global, it’s become known for phones that pack in some surprising features at a fairly affordable price point.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 exemplifies that trend, with an attractive chunky design, great screen, and a clean, stock version of Android thanks to the Android One program—all at a price that’s competitive with other mid-range handsets.</p><p> The mid-range Android market is a crowded field, so we put the Nokia 7.1 to the test around the office and at home to see how it holds up in real-world, day-to-day use.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-android-smartphones-577403" >Phone Reviews &amp; Top Picks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Design-A-mid-range-phone-with-high-end-sensibilities"><a href="#Design-A-mid-range-phone-with-high-end-sensibilities" class="headerlink" title="Design: A mid-range phone with high-end sensibilities"></a><strong>Design: A mid-range phone with high-end sensibilities</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 is a mid-range handset that could pass for a higher-end device if you squint. It features the same general design—a glass front and back separated by an aluminum body—that we’ve seen so many times before, but it has a few design tweaks that help it stand out. The matte aluminum body features chamfered edges that add a bit of visual flair, especially when they catch the light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1cMJEwjyd7B1WxBO7uBZOm0C2So=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_3-483bfb6a868848adaaf021846b9fb559.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p> The buttons are all located on the right side of the device, and they feature the same chamfered shape as the main body of the phone. The positioning of the buttons makes them easy to hit with your index finger when you hold the device in your left hand, or with your thumb if you hold it in your right.</p><p> When you turn the screen on, the first thing you notice is a chunky notch at the top. This notch is the reason that the phone is able to boast a 5.8-inch display, but it seems like a strange choice when paired with the thick “chin” at the bottom of the screen. This use of space definitely looks mid-range.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NRHkz82CaIGpj9N3UQuqHzPSBas=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_4-2c6261afee9644848e68fbf1e73c3009.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Requires-updates-out-of-the-box"><a href="#Setup-Process-Requires-updates-out-of-the-box" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Requires updates out of the box"></a><strong>Setup Process: Requires updates out of the box</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Nokia 7.1 is a breeze if you have a Google account ready to go.

The only hiccup we experienced was the flood of required updates right out of the box—make sure you allow some extra time to download and install everything.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/LkCNBmkQjVwHH-SoT7i4QFOrSsk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_1-83b2f49a5f2c4443b2b7f30b502fd094.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Performance-Great-for-a-mid-range-handset"><a href="#Performance-Great-for-a-mid-range-handset" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Great for a mid-range handset"></a><strong>Performance: Great for a mid-range handset</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 isn’t a powerhouse, but it offers great performance compared to a lot of other mid-range handsets. It features the Snapdragon 636 processor, Adreno 509 GPU, and 4GB of RAM, which is pretty good for a mid-range device like this.</p><p> We ran PCMark’s Work 2.0 benchmark, which tests how well a phone is able to handle basic productivity tasks like web browsing, word processing, and even editing photos and videos. It received a respectable score of 6,113. That lags behind higher-end devices but compares very favorably to handsets in this price range.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 showed great strength in photo editing with a massive score of 11,093 but lagged behind in data manipulation with a score of 4,792.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 is a mid-range handset in terms of price, but it packs a lot of features that you’d expect from a much more expensive phone.</p><p> We also ran two GFXBench tests to see how the Nokia 7.1 holds up. It performed poorly on the Car Chase benchmark, only managing 5.8 fps, but it did much better on the T-Rex test, notching a much more acceptable 33 fps.</p><p> In real-world conditions, the Nokia 7.1 is snappy enough that it won’t trip you up during regular daily tasks like web browsing, email, and streaming video. It’s also powerful enough to run some games, but you’ll have to stay away from the highest graphics settings.</p><p> It’s important to note that when the Nokia 7.1 launched, it was plagued with complaints about slow operation, lag, and an unresponsive touchscreen. These appear to have been software-related issues that have since been fixed, as we experienced no such problems in our hands-on testing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983545">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983545">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983545%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983545/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Data-connection-is-slow"><a href="#Connectivity-Data-connection-is-slow" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Data connection is slow"></a><strong>Connectivity: Data connection is slow</strong></h2><p> In our testing, the Nokia 7.1 performed exceedingly well when connected to Wi-Fi, but it had far more problems with mobile data compared to similar handsets we tested.

There is very little bass response though, even compared to other mid-range handsets. The speaker is there if you need it, but you’ll want to plug in headphones or use an external speaker whenever possible. The Nokia 7.1 does includes a headphone jack, located on the top edge of the device, and comes with a pair of earbuds in the box.</p><h2 id="Camera-Video-Quality-Surprisingly-competent-camera"><a href="#Camera-Video-Quality-Surprisingly-competent-camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera&#x2F;Video Quality: Surprisingly competent camera"></a><strong>Camera&#x2F;Video Quality: Surprisingly competent camera</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 has two rear-facing cameras, 12 MP and 5 MP respectively. The 5 MP one is used for depth sensing to help keep your subjects in focus. The lenses are housed in a bump protrusion, outlined by the same shining metal seen on the edges of the phone.</p><p> The camera performs well in a range of lighting situations, and Nokia’s camera app provides you with a pro mode that allows you to manually control aspects like white balance and ISO.</p><p> One issue to keep in mind is that when you take a picture with the Nokia 7.1 and view it on the handset, you’re looking at an HDR-enhanced display that upscales regular photos and video with an HDR look.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VI32Dr6kjQKlJti1W9Egtq7kb10=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_2-b7780c375da34f349ba0c037120ee3ff.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027190/19272" target="_top" id="2027190">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027190" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027190/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/4d-M-nqoc9xpcT44HdNVobPQU1U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gs9-photo9-7b35a0c91bd544ae89dab81238efdda2.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1 rose photo"                ></p><p>Lifewire</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hepqa5K_YkbwuC1_7lRbkLgxJVc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/cat-photo7-e1f061ad95324519a4cd85a39faeb1a7.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1 cat photo"                ></p><p>Lifewire</p><p> This means a photo that looks fantastic on the phone may look washed out or less clear when viewed on another device. The camera is capable of taking great snaps, but it’s important to keep that in mind. If you want your pictures to look as brilliant on your computer as they do on your phone, you’ll have to make some image adjustments after the fact.</p><p> The handset also supports the “bothie” feature that Nokia has been pushing. This feature enables you to take photos or videos with the front-facing and rear-facing cameras at the same time (if that’s something you ever felt the need to do). It also has a very competent Bokeh feature that holds your subject in sharp focus while blurring the background.</p><p> The hardware just isn’t there to challenge the best phone cameras found in flagship devices from the likes of Samsung, Apple, or Google, but the Nokia 7.1 doesn’t come with a flagship price tag either.</p><h2 id="Battery-Enough-to-last-through-the-work-day"><a href="#Battery-Enough-to-last-through-the-work-day" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Enough to last through the work day"></a><strong>Battery: Enough to last through the work day</strong></h2><p> In our testing, we found the battery life to be somewhat lacking.

For example, the Motorola One retails at $399 and has a lower resolution display, a less competent camera, and an older, slower processor.</p><p> That processor, the Snapdragon 625, is even older and slower than the Snapdragon 630 found in the budget-priced Nokia 6.1. It’s also about 40 percent slower than the Nokia 7.1’s own Snapdragon 636.</p><p> The display and camera found in the Nokia 7.1 are also significantly better than those found in other handsets in this price range.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 doesn’t compare as favorably to higher-end phones like the $549 OnePlus 6T, which blows it out of the water in both benchmark and real-world testing. But the Nokia 7.1 doesn’t come with that premium price tag, either.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Premium features and great looks, all on a budget.</strong></p><p> The Nokia 7.1 isn’t a high-end device, but it brings a lot of premium quality and features to the table. If you’re in the market for a solid mid-range handset, you won’t do much better than this.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oneplus-6t-phone-review-4589385" >OnePlus 6T <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nokia-6-1-review-4689956" >Nokia 6.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/motorola-moto-g6-review-4689366" >Motorola Moto G6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135365/19272" target="_top" id="2135365">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135365" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135365/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  7.1</li><li>Product Brand  Nokia</li><li>Price  $349.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2018</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.9 x 2.8 x 0.4 in.</li><li>Color  6291898</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Android Pie</li><li>Processor  Qualcomm Snapdragon 636</li><li>GPU  Adreno 509</li><li>RAM  3 GB</li><li>Storage  32 GB or 64 GB</li><li>Display  5.84 inches</li><li>Camera  12 MP rear, 5 MP front-facing</li><li>Battery Capacity  3,060 mAh</li><li>Ports  USB-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack</li><li>Waterproof  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-beginners-aerial-adventure-top-10-best-kids-drones-for-2024/"><u>[New] Beginner's Aerial Adventure Top 10 Best Kids' Drones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-gaming-history-told-by-top-video-makers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Gaming History Told by Top Video Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-streamlined-recording-of-powerpoint-slides-via-webcam/"><u>[Updated] Streamlined Recording of PowerPoint Slides via Webcam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/4-ways-to-transfer-music-from-lava-yuva-2-to-iphone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>4 Ways to Transfer Music from Lava Yuva 2 to iPhone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/beat-blast-innovative-audio/"><u>Beat Blast Innovative Audio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-complete-guide-to-oem-unlocking-on-vivo-y56-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, A Complete Guide To OEM Unlocking on Vivo Y56 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-car-locator-apps-for-vivo-t2-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 5 Car Locator Apps for Vivo T2 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-4-sim-location-trackers-to-easily-find-your-lost-vivo-s18e-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 4 SIM Location Trackers To Easily Find Your Lost Vivo S18e Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/top-rated-desk-treadmills-for-active-workers/"><u>Top Rated Desk Treadmills for Active Workers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/top-rated-gaming-monitors-and-projectors-2023s-ultimate-guide/"><u>Top Rated Gaming Monitors and Projectors - 2023'S Ultimate Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/top-rated-live-television-streaming-platforms/"><u>Top Rated Live Television Streaming Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/top-rated-feline-gadget-playthings-the-ultimate-guide-to-2023s-must-have-cat-toys/"><u>Top-Rated Feline Gadget Playthings: The Ultimate Guide to 2023'S Must-Have Cat Toys</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/top-rated-nintendo-switch-audio-gear-finding-the-ideal-headset/"><u>Top-Rated Nintendo Switch Audio Gear: Finding the Ideal Headset</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Forerunner 45 is one of the newest devices from Garmin: a running-focused watch with full<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-gps-how-it-works-4688647" >GPS capabilities <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to track your runs, hikes, and rides. The FR45 looks and feels like a traditional digital timepiece, featuring a flexible rubber wrist band, an intuitive button interface, and a no-nonsense graphical display. This watch is mostly designed for runners and clearly gets its name with race training in mind, though it’s also suited for any other athletes who are looking to push their limits.</p><p> Despite a heavy focus on running, walkers, hikers and bike riders will also get plenty out of this watch as it includes specific sport modes for each activity. In addition to a host of ‘widgets’ to track your daily fitness like heart rate, step counting, and calorie counting, the FR45 offers more advanced tools like on-screen workouts with the adaptive Garmin Coach training plans for racing various distances.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oA3-JLbM6PIUG83S2eDF63Qprhs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4057119-02-2ae60f7c5a5345ccad8649eadf02637c.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Forerunner 45"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136626/26400" target="_top" id="2136626">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136626" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136626/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Charge-sync-and-go"><a href="#Setup-Process-Charge-sync-and-go" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Charge, sync, and go"></a><strong>Setup Process: Charge, sync, and go</strong></h2><p> The Garmin Forerunner 45 is easy and quick to set up. Download the Garmin Connect app on your phone or tablet (available in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store) and you can easily sync it to the watch.</p><p> You’ll need the app anyway to view your fitness data, and when you connect it to your Forerunner right out of the box, it also gives you some quick tips for navigating the watch’s interface during the setup process.</p><p> Once you sync it to the app and charge it up to 100%, you’re ready to wear your new Forerunner 45 and get going.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dDyZtrCdCkQOgVcBV6cAwVcFi68=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4057119-04-2c87d86b2b60411b9ebf6696851a2d3b.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Forerunner 45"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123726/7443" target="_top" id="2123726">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123726" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123726/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043596/7443" target="_top" id="2043596">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043596" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043596/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Traditional-digital-watch-design-with-all-day-comfort"><a href="#Design-Traditional-digital-watch-design-with-all-day-comfort" class="headerlink" title="Design: Traditional digital watch design with all-day comfort"></a><strong>Design: Traditional digital watch design with all-day comfort</strong></h2><p> Featuring a simple circular watch design and basic rubber wristband, the FR45 looks natural and feels sporty—it’s more understated than flashy. You could certainly wear this watch in a professional setting, but it does not exude the formal or super tech-savvy aesthetic that many smartwatches do these days.</p><p> The unit is lightweight and leaves you unencumbered when you are exercising. The Forerunner 45 does not feel especially rugged or super durable, although it does have a chemically-strengthened glass screen. It’s waterproof to 50 meters, but perhaps disappointingly, this model does not feature any swim mode.</p><p> The screen is totally flush with the bezels and doesn’t leave any space for sweat, grime or dirt to get stuck. The circular bezel of the watch face is rounded and made of the same smooth plastic material that the entire watch body is constructed of (which again does not feel exceedingly durable or rugged), but it sits comfortably flat on the back of your wrist and is easily wearable all day.</p><p> The wristband is made of a flexible silicone material and has a lightly textured exterior side, while the interior side of the band (against your skin) is smooth. Thanks to its comfortable band and smaller overall size, it’s can be worn overnight to get 24&#x2F;7 heart rate data and sleep monitoring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nHZkcIXB7C8qBgrCAwhmdxoMV0Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4057119-03-b3713bbdd0f244b889d434fbe17613b7.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Forerunner 45"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Performance-Sport-modes-sleep-tracking-and-Garmin-Coach"><a href="#Performance-Sport-modes-sleep-tracking-and-Garmin-Coach" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Sport modes, sleep tracking, and Garmin Coach"></a><strong>Performance: Sport modes, sleep tracking, and Garmin Coach</strong></h2><p> We tested the Forerunner 45 on a series of daily trail runs plus a long run and were pleased with its functionality. It features an optical heart rate sensor that charts your average and max heart rates plus an estimation of your V02 max⁠ (the maximum amount of oxygen you can uptake during exercise).</p><p> The ‘Run’ mode features customizable data screens that you can scroll through to review a variety of relevant stats during your workout.</p><p> The Forerunner 45 also has full GPS + GLONASS and GALILEO capabilities. GLONASS is Russia’s version of the American GPS system and GALILEO is the EU’s satellite system, so it really does have all the bases covered here.</p><p> The “Run” mode on the FR45 features customizable data screens that you can scroll through to review a variety of relevant stats during your workout. The default data screen shows your elapsed time, current mile pace and distance, with average and max heart rates, lap times, V02 Max and more that you can review with the push of a button. You can also customize time or distance interval alerts (every 10 minutes, every mile, etc.) and the FR45 will buzz and beep you to notify you of your progress.</p><p> The sleep monitoring feature on the Forerunner 45 tracks how many hours you have slept and periods of movement or restful sleep. This data is reviewable in the Garmin Connect app. The ability of the FR45 to continually track your heart rate and sleep quality overnight makes it a good tool if you are looking to most accurately gauge your resting heart rate and training load before or mid-way through a training program.</p><p> Garmin Coach is a powerful feature on the FR45. When you first sync the Forerunner 45 with your smartphone, the Garmin Connect app will give you the opportunity to select a training program from three real-life professional running coaches. The app has a short video introduction to each coach’s plan and they give you a little info about what their training system is all about. Each plan is a multi-week training program for 5K, 10K, and half-marathon distances.</p><p> The different plans all have you do two to three workouts per week in addition to your easy runs. The Garmin Coach training plans sync with your Forerunner watch and give you onscreen instructions for those workouts, which include intervals, negative splits, tempo runs, long runs, and more. Once you complete a workout during a run, you can select how difficult it was for you and Garmin Coach will adapt its recommendations for you to avoid burnout or overtraining.</p><p> The Garmin Connect app will give you the opportunity to select a training program from three real-life professional running coaches.</p><p> Garmin Coach can also adjust itself based on performance metrics like heart rate and V02 max to either push you if you’re improving or dial things back if you’re going too hard.</p><h2 id="Battery-Long-battery-life-for-days-of-activity-or-races"><a href="#Battery-Long-battery-life-for-days-of-activity-or-races" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Long battery life for days of activity or races"></a><strong>Battery: Long battery life for days of activity or races</strong></h2><p> The Garmin Forerunner 45 has a rechargeable lithium battery that can last up to seven days in normal watch mode and up to 13 hours continuously when in GPS mode.</p><p> 13 hours in GPS mode means the FR45 won’t die on you in the middle of a marathon, 50K, or possibly even longer races. During our testing process, we found the battery life lasted about four days with daily training runs, all of which lasted around 45 minutes. The FR45 charges back up to 100% in about an hour’s time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/n0CH4Oi-eCGFGFAbYCvyN1zYh5s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4057119-05-60bd2ccaf84c4b588407fb69ec57cf39.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Forerunner 45"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Software-Minimal-graphics-with-widgets-in-place-of-apps"><a href="#Software-Minimal-graphics-with-widgets-in-place-of-apps" class="headerlink" title="Software: Minimal graphics with widgets in place of apps"></a><strong>Software: Minimal graphics with widgets in place of apps</strong></h2><p> The FR45 has a minimal OS and the visuals of the display are quite basic. The screen is always on and the simple graphics are designed for high visibility when you are on the move and working out, which is ideal for checking your progress during exercise. The display feels very utilitarian and the graphics do exactly what they intend to do: tell you the info you need to know without any distractions.</p><p> In place of apps on the Forerunner 45, you get widgets for charting wellness model fundamentals like step counting and calories. The FR45 includes Garmin-specific widgets like a stress meter and “body battery,” the latter of which charts how much energy you have throughout the day.</p><p> The entire watch design, app ecosystem, and integration are truly optimized for running, but it does accommodate other sport modes like biking, cardio, walking, and yoga.</p><p> This watch does not have any music storage capabilities or Garmin Pay, but it will show you notifications when in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412" >Bluetooth range <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of your smartphone and also displays the weather. You can also upload your activities to Garmin Connect and a range of exercise apps including Strava. The entire watch design, app ecosystem, and integration are truly optimized for running, but it does accommodate other sport modes like biking, cardio, walking, and yoga.</p><p> The FR45 has a few safety features, including incident detection and safety alerts. Incident detection can tell if you fall while running or crash on your bike and can send an emergency message to a predetermined emergency contact.</p><p> The safety alert is similar, allowing you to send a preset alert message with your location as a follow link to a designated emergency contact. But unlike incident detection, the safety alert is sent manually and designed to be used any time you find yourself in a potentially unsafe situation while out running or biking. Both of these features require that your smartphone is within Bluetooth range.</p><h2 id="Price-Training-essentials-for-a-decent-price"><a href="#Price-Training-essentials-for-a-decent-price" class="headerlink" title="Price: Training essentials for a decent price"></a><strong>Price: Training essentials for a decent price</strong></h2><p> The Garmin Forerunner 45 carries an MSRP of $199.99, which is a pretty decent deal for a GPS watch with the added Garmin Coach features.</p><p> Garmin has clearly designed the FR45 to be one of the more affordable GPS running watches in its line up, with a prerogative to deliver all the core fitness essentials without any of the ancillary features like maps, music storage, or Garmin Pay that the pricier models play up.</p><p> Unless you are specifically looking for other features in a Garmin GPS watch for specific uses, chances are you won’t miss them for daily running with the Forerunner 45.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Garmin-Forerunner-45-vs-Polar-Ignite"><a href="#Competition-Garmin-Forerunner-45-vs-Polar-Ignite" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Garmin Forerunner 45 vs. Polar Ignite"></a><strong>Competition: Garmin Forerunner 45 vs. Polar Ignite</strong></h2><p> Options abound in the active lifestyle wearables market, and the $200 range is a good benchmark price for getting a full-GPS watch with a variety of training tools.</p><p> A competing model is the Polar Ignite GPS watch, which carries an MSRP of $229.99 and boasts similar fitness tracking features like steps, calories, and continual heart rate monitoring with a circular watch design similar to the FR45. The Ignite has a slightly higher-resolution display and is a touchscreen, but it is designed to only illuminate when you raise your wrist (although settings can be modified to keep the display always-on at the sacrifice of battery life).</p><p> The Polar Ignite features the same full GPS + GLONASS capabilities as the FR45 to track your outdoor activities with pace and distance, plus it includes similar V02 max and optical heart rate sensing capabilities. The Ignite also features Polar’s versions of adaptive training plans called FitSpark Daily Training Guide, which include on-screen workouts and running-specific training programs called Polar Smart Coaching.</p><p> Now for some key differences: Despite hosting a majority of runner-specific features like the FR45, the Polar Ignite has over 100 different sport modes, a ton more than the Forerunner 45. It also has more running-specific modes like trail running and Ultrarunning. The full functionality of these modes is beyond the scope of this review, but it is important to consider how the addition of extra modes really serves your training and intended use.</p><p> While the Forerunner is very focused on the delivery of core data—time, pace, heart rate, and distance—with a no-frills display, the Ignite has a higher level of integration with Polar’s Flow app for all the different activities. Polar seems to be trying to attract athletes beyond the running core that Garmin targets.</p><p> The Polar Ignite also boasts a longer battery life while in GPS + heart rate mode, lasting up to 17 hours. It includes swim tracking (which the Forerunner 45 does not have) and tracks data like heart rate, strokes, distance, pace, and rest times. It can even detect your swimming style. This could be a big plus for triathletes, but it should be noted that the Polar Ignite does not have the ability to sync with a speed sensor on a bike to get cadence data, which the Forerunner 45 can do.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A top-quality running watch at a decent price.</strong></p><p> The Garmin Forerunner 45 is streamlined to provide all your core training features at a good price. It is definitely geared towards runners and relies pretty heavily on a smartphone connection for its more advanced features. But if you are looking for a reliable GPS watch to help you train—and you don’t want to spend too much—the Forerunner 45 is worth considering.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130873/7443" target="_top" id="2130873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948949/19272" target="_top" id="1948949">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948949" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948949/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151869/7443" target="_top" id="2151869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2127886">                    <video width="576" height="1024" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2127886.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2127886">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2127886.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2127886%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2127886/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/999558/11832" target="_top" id="999558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-999558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/999558/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144274/7443" target="_top" id="2144274">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144274" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144274/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-10-2-inch-7th-generation-review-4772313" >Apple iPad 10.2-inch (7th Generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-go-review-4690827" >Microsoft Surface Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-mini-2019-review-4688991" >Apple iPad Mini (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  iPad Pro 11-Inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>Price  $799.99</li><li>Release Date  November 2018</li><li>Weight  1.03 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.02 x 9.74 x 0.23 in.</li><li>Color  Space Gray</li><li>Warranty  Applecare</li><li>RAM  4 GB</li><li>Camera  12 MP</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-instagram-highlights-covers-apps-for-iphone-and-android/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Best Instagram Highlights Covers Apps for iPhone and Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-iphone-techniques-for-full-sphere-videography/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved IPhone Techniques for Full-Sphere Videography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-essential-blueprint-for-melding-linktree-into-tiktok-profiles/"><u>[Updated] The Essential Blueprint for Melding Linktree Into TikTok Profiles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-outstanding.techidaily.com/download-microsoft-office-at-no-cost-a-step-by-step-guide-techtips/"><u>Download Microsoft Office at No Cost - A Step-by-Step Guide | TechTips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-understanding-budgets-youtube-marketing-investments/"><u>In 2024, Understanding Budgets YouTube Marketing Investments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/innovative-approaches-to-vector-graphics-using-the-best-software-for-2024/"><u>Innovative Approaches to Vector Graphics Using the Best Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/itel-a05s-camera-not-working-unexpected-error-fix-it-now-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Itel A05s Camera Not Working Unexpected Error?

It comes from a long series of Rayman games but brings an upgrade in graphics and gameplay, creating a game that not only longtime fans will be happy with, but first-time players, too. We played this game on the PS4 to further explore the game’s plot, gameplay, graphics, and sound design―and we were not disappointed.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-as-it-should-be"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-as-it-should-be" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy as it should be"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy as it should be</strong></h2><p> Setup for Rayman Legends is what you would expect. You’ll open up the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ps4-ps4-slim-and-ps4-pro-4154452" >PlayStation 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> case (or if you buy the game electronically through your PS4, you’ll begin the download process after purchase), pop in the disk, and you’ll be ready to play. Be aware, though, that certain features of the game will not be accessible if your PS4 is not connected to the internet. Specifically, you won’t be able to access the Challenges mode, where you can play weekly challenges against other Rayman Legends players.</p><h2 id="Plot-Not-much-of-one-but-who-cares"><a href="#Plot-Not-much-of-one-but-who-cares" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Not much of one, but who cares?"></a><strong>Plot: Not much of one, but who cares?</strong></h2><p> The Rayman games have been around for years, dating back to the original, which was published in 1995. Since then, the story, characters, art, and gameplay have come a long way. In this game, you’ll choose a level―each of which is uniquely themed and has multiple maps for you to work your way through.</p><p> Rayman Legends isn’t focused on plot; it’s more interested in providing outstanding gameplay.</p><p> Once you’ve loaded into a map, you’ll come face to face with the hero’s enemy, the Magician. He’s determined to capture all the royal Teensies in the game (a small blue creature you must find and set free in each map).</p><p> You’ll chase after him, jumping from platform to platform, slaying the occasional enemy as you go. That’s about it when it comes to the plot of Rayman Legends. Sometimes the Magician will give you a specific enemy to dodge, like a giant red dragon, and at the end of certain maps, you’ll get an opportunity to catch him. But really, Rayman Legends isn’t focused on plot; it’s more interested in providing outstanding gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-Un250xgOCxgaGgFeykC6pihaaU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RaymanLegends_20190118212347-5c8ffe8d46e0fb0001f8d0cc.jpg"                      alt="Rayman Legends"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Gameplay-What-this-is-really-about"><a href="#Gameplay-What-this-is-really-about" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: What this is really about"></a><strong>Gameplay: What this is really about</strong></h2><p> Rayman Legends is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-platform-game-812371" >2D platformer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , reminiscent of such games as Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong, but with its own history and development. Be prepared to do lots of jumping, the occasional timed run, and even a few boss fights. Thankfully, Rayman Legend is fairly forgiving when it comes to platformers. The controls are smooth, jumps are generally easy to land, and a glide feature can save you when you accidentally jump too late. Plus, a nice distribution of save points make it easy to try again if you do die.</p><p> While each level does get progressively harder as you go (indicated by the number of small skulls under the map entrance), most are achievable by the average player. There’s also the added bonus that if you are having trouble, you can force your friend to join you. When one of you dies, you’ll just turn into a bubble and your friend can free you with an attack.</p><p> This game is fairly forgiving: The controls are smooth, jumps are generally easy to land, and a glide feature can save you when you accidentally jump too late.</p><p> Teaming up for the harder levels not only makes the game a little easier, but it also makes the game more fun. You can co-op with up to four people at a time on the PS4, which combined with the casual and fun nature of the game makes it a great recommendation for best friends or for a couple who enjoys gaming together.</p><p> In the game, there are six levels, each with roughly ten maps. You’ll have to work your way through the first level to unlock the second, and so forth. Unlocks are achieved when you reach a certain number of Teensies saved―which the Magician has locked up and hidden in various places throughout each map. There is also a type of in-game currency called “Lums” that you collect as you run through each map (they look like pink or gold fireflies).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oJz1vIp26cdVH1115RCHTapRpTE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RaymanLegends_20190118215643-5c8ffe7346e0fb000146adbb.jpg"                      alt="Rayman Legends"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094422/7443" target="_top" id="2094422">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094422" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094422/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> When you’ve reached a certain number of Lums, you’ll be able to unlock new heroes, which there is no shortage of. The levels grow gradually more complex as you progress, and while we admit that most levels weren’t too difficult, a few at the end of the game will be challenging for even well-practiced players.</p><p> Beyond the basic six levels and maps, the game’s other features are also great. There is a Soccer mode, where you play on a small 2D field versus your friend; scratchers that are rewarded after certain levels, where you use the PS4’s touchpad to reveal a random reward; and a creatures page where you can view all the weird Rayman creatures you’ve collected from scratchers.</p><p> Our favorite feature is the ability to unlock levels from Rayman Origins, the game that came before Rayman Legends. It’s like you’re getting two games for the price of one.</p><p> The Challenges mode, which we mentioned earlier, is where you can attempt weekly challenges, earn rewards, and get your username on the leaderboards. The last feature―our favorite―is the ability to unlock levels from Rayman Origins, the game that came before Rayman Legends. It’s like you’re getting two games for the price of one.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134496/18498" target="_top" id="2134496">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134496" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134496/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Cartoony-but-appropriate"><a href="#Graphics-Cartoony-but-appropriate" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Cartoony but appropriate"></a><strong>Graphics: Cartoony but appropriate</strong></h2><p> Rayman Legends has a unique look, which is represented fairly well by its bright and eye-catching cover.

But there is one thing worth mentioning when it comes to the sound and music of the game―and in our opinion, it’s the coolest thing about Rayman Legends.</p><p> At the end of each level, a special map is unlocked. This map is themed to fit with the level’s design, and each features a specific song. You’ll load in, be told to prepare yourself to run at full speed while jumping and smashing enemies, and then, as you set off, the first notes of the song begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JIMvxIzHzgo1AXBmpTp3LxpzmTQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RaymanLegends_20190118210656-5c9001cd46e0fb000172f0b1.jpg"                      alt="Rayman Legends"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> The beauty of these maps is how well the gameplay is designed to match the beats of the song, from how each jump will strike with the strum of a guitar, or how the smash of a drum will be timed with the slaying of an enemy. The levels might take you a few tries to finish, as they’re timed and require precision, but they’re fun enough you won’t mind doing them again.</p><h2 id="Price-Very-reasonable-for-the-content"><a href="#Price-Very-reasonable-for-the-content" class="headerlink" title="Price: Very reasonable for the content"></a><strong>Price: Very reasonable for the content</strong></h2><p> Rayman Legends can be purchased for most systems at around $20. Sometimes PlayStation will put the item on sale, and you might even be able to get a copy for less than $15.</p><p> The Nintendo Switch version of the game is more expensive, so beware. However, no matter which system you’d prefer to play on, the value is worth it. The game has a lot of extra content and is more than fun enough to warrant the cost.</p><p> Deal alert</p><p> Sometimes PlayStation will put the item on sale, and you might even be able to get a copy for less than $15.</p><h2 id="Competition-More-co-op-platformers"><a href="#Competition-More-co-op-platformers" class="headerlink" title="Competition: More co-op platformers"></a><strong>Competition: More co-op platformers</strong></h2><p> If you enjoy the Rayman characters and style, there are a lot more Rayman games to explore. We probably wouldn’t suggest getting Rayman Origins since much of that gameplay is included in Rayman Legends, but one could look at Rayman Adventures. If you’re looking for other fun co-op platformers, we would suggest any of the Trine games, which focus on character-swapping and puzzles more than Rayman Legends, or Nintendo’s New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe for the classic Mario experience.</p><p> Read more reviews of the best PlayStation 4 kids games available to purchase online.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Get this game. It’s fun, creative, and different.</strong></p><p> Between the co-op option, the extra levels, the ability to replay Rayman Origins, and all the other things you can unlock from special heroes to scratchers, this game has a lot to offer for gamers of all ages.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lego-dimensions-review-4686589" >LEGO Worlds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/minecraft-review-4777049" >Minecraft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ratchet-and-clank-review-4777051" >Ratchet &amp; Clank <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Rayman Legends</li><li>Product Brand  Ubisoft</li><li>SKU  3069036</li><li>Price  $29.99</li><li>Release Date  February 2014</li><li>Weight  3.2 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.3 x 0.6 x 6.7 in.</li><li>Number of Players  Up to 4</li><li>Recommended Age  10+</li><li>Available Platforms  Microsoft Windows (Origin), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360, Xbox One</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-audio-gear-reviews-and-ratings/"><u>[New] In 2024, Audio Gear Reviews & Ratings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-full-spectrum-analysis-the-logitech-4k-pro-webcam/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Full Spectrum Analysis The Logitech 4K Pro Webcam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-comprehensive-movement-study-2023/"><u>[Updated] Comprehensive Movement Study 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-from-novice-to-experienced-6-strategies-for-quick-verification-on-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From Novice to Experienced 6 Strategies for Quick Verification on Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/affordable-and-compact-excellence-in-depth-look-at-the-samsung-galaxy-s10e/"><u>Affordable & Compact Excellence: In-Depth Look at the Samsung Galaxy S10e</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-data.techidaily.com/comprehensive-fixes-for-universal-windows-11-spinning-wheel-glitch-across-various-cases/"><u>Comprehensive Fixes for Universal Windows 11 Spinning Wheel Glitch Across Various Cases</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/discover-the-magic-behind-apples-all-in-one-desktop-a-critical-look-at-the-imac-4k-model/"><u>Discover the Magic Behind Apple's All-in-One Desktop: A Critical Look at the iMac 4K Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fake-snapchat-location-on-honor-90-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Fake Snapchat Location on Honor 90 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-experience-with-viber-out-app/"><u>In-Depth Analysis: Experience with Viber Out App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/tp-link-archer-c9-unveiled-a-leading-contender-amongst-economical-wireless-routers/"><u>TP-Link Archer C9 Unveiled: A Leading Contender Amongst Economical Wireless Routers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-power-of-portability-with-the-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-productivity-redefined/"><u>Unveiling the Power of Portability with the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 - Productivity Redefined</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

A good webcam has HD resolution, quality sound, and is easy to use. We tested the Logitech C615 Webcam to see whether it can deliver what you need to start recording your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/86PZ5XCiq91ihr7-8UNmM5io9pY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_4_Final_Horiz-bad356a5002b4156859dca672e8a8eb4.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Design-Flexible-foldable-design"><a href="#Design-Flexible-foldable-design" class="headerlink" title="Design: Flexible, foldable design"></a><strong>Design:</strong> <strong>Flexible, foldable design</strong></h2><p> The Logitech C615 is a compact webcam. The whole device folds up into a very small package, just 2.5” wide, 1.25” tall, and 1.5” wide, so you can tuck it into a pocket. When you open it up, the flexible design is simple to position. Unfolded, the webcam has three pieces: the base, neck, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-digital-cameras-under-100-3897833" >camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The base is the heaviest part, which means that the camera stays upright even if you don’t perfectly balance everything. The top is made out of a soft, rubbery plastic, and the bottom has a rubbery dot that keeps the base from sliding around. The dot comes off the base to reveal a tripod post, so this camera is compatible with a standard tripod. The only problem is that the dot comes off completely when the tripod post is exposed. If you’re prone to losing things, this may be an issue.</p><p> The thoughtful design, image quality, and microphone clarity easily justify the price tag.</p><p> The base’s rubbery surface kept the Logitech C615 From sliding around when we mounted it on our HD TV, even when we moved the USB cable around. The neck is a thin plastic piece that has a lip for mounting the camera to an LCD TV or computer monitor. There are also two rubber strips on the sides to keep it from sliding back and forth when mounted.</p><p> The camera section is made of black plastic with a cropped silver plastic circle around the lens. To the left of the lens there’s an indicator light to show when the camera is on, and the microphone sits to the right of the lens. The 360 swivel not only makes the Logitech C615 easy to position, it also makes it possible to fold the camera lens in on itself to protect it on the go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jgQ_lVlvzgmXFPpBg5nEd6pgV_c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_12_Final_Horiz-e97c48d3af6842eb88775a9d703ce2b6.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997695/19272" target="_top" id="1997695">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997695" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997695/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles</strong></h2><p> The camera takes 1080p video and has a 2 MP sensor. We tested the webcam’s photo capabilities by taking a picture of some packaging. Color was well represented, but the autofocus was just a bit off. The image was just a bit blurry, and we couldn’t read the smaller words at all. This wasn’t a problem close up, but it made a bigger difference when people were far away.</p><p> Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow.</p><p> The autofocus also had trouble when there was an object between the camera and the people on which we wanted to focus it. It worked best when we pointed the camera at the background. When a person walked into the shot, the autofocus detected the person and focused on him. When there was a little glare in the background of the shot, the C615 completely blew out those highlights, showing only a bright white light. If you’re going to use this in a fluorescent office with steady, even light it won’t be a problem. Annoying for video chat, but a big problem if you’re using it for YouTube or streaming your game feed.</p><p> The video is 1080p, and looks it. Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow, though it does suffer from some minor depth of field issues when multiple people are in frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Bko9Uk1HIIMt9aNgtBf9ATCy0AA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_14_Final_Horiz-4f1b9fe91b8c4229b17dbbe6afb81b8c.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144285/7443" target="_top" id="2144285">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144285" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144285/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic"><a href="#Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic"></a><strong>Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic</strong></h2><p> We used both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test the performance of the C615.

The HD camera made the video look great, and video and sound were in sync. Close up, the sound was clear but with a thin, distorted tone.

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> If you use your laptop for playing games or running high-performance apps, then you’ve probably seen it get very warm and kick on its potentially loud internal fans. However, the built-in fans can only do so much to dissipate the immense heat built within, try as they might. That’s where laptop cooling pads come in, blasting additional cool air into your laptop to help take down the internal and external temperatures.</p><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops.</p><p> Kootek’s Laptop Cooling Pad isn’t the cheapest option around, nor is it the most premium—but it’s effective and sells for a reasonable price, and is large enough to accommodate larger laptops with 17-inch displays. A clunky height adjustment system is the main drawback, but it doesn’t stop the Kootek pad from working as expected.</p><h2 id="Design-Clunky-but-it-works"><a href="#Design-Clunky-but-it-works" class="headerlink" title="Design: Clunky, but it works"></a>Design: Clunky, but it works</h2><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a larger unit, measuring nearly 15 inches wide, 11.8 inches tall, and about 1.4 inches thick, with a weight of 2.6 pounds. It’s heavier and bulkier than the lightweight TopMate C302 Cooling Pad, for example, and feels more durable as a result.</p><p> It’s built for laptops with screens between 12 and 17 inches diagonal, with a wide metal grate on the surface to help dissipate heat as the five fans blow onto your laptop. Most of the rest of the build is plastic. Each fan has red LED lighting for an added glow to the pad.</p><p> The height adjustment system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution.</p><p> Two flip-up, padded stoppers at the bottom of the surface help keep your laptop in place even when you have the pad angled, thanks to the height adjustment system. Granted, that system is easily my least favorite part of this cooling pad.</p><p> Essentially, there’s a loose metal bar hanging from the main unit of the cooling pad, and you’ll slot that into one of six ridges on the bottom stand to prop it up. The system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution. It works and it provides finer-grain height adjustment levels, but it feels like a clunky solution for a tech accessory.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6Uuby879oWyaUH6_3WN7ZssAF-g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_04-73dc23f85de34fa087b21b21461f9f74.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> There are two buttons at the back of the pad: One button controls the large, central fan (4.72 inches), while the other controls the four smaller fans (2.76 inches each). I’m not sure why you would choose to use only some fans at any given time, since they’re all quiet, but the option is there if you want it. You’ll also find two USB-A ports, meaning this cooling pad functions as a hub for plugging additional accessories into your laptop.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Very-straightforward"><a href="#Setup-Process-Very-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Very straightforward"></a>Setup Process: Very straightforward</h2><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad doesn’t require any software or its own power unit to function. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the height as desired, and then plug the built-in USB cable into your laptop to power it on. As mentioned, you can control the fans using the buttons at the back of the pad, and the USB ports can be used for additional accessories.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A5iJ3c7mD8guT4DKXitqb3wlp6I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_03-9ec8e6afd494441f8ae20c38ae1fadbb.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135367/19272" target="_top" id="2135367">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135367" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135367/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Cool-and-quiet"><a href="#Performance-Cool-and-quiet" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Cool and quiet"></a>Performance: Cool and quiet</h2><p> I tested the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad with the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , featuring an Intel Core i7-9750H processor with 16GB RAM, along with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (6GB). It’s a solidly powerful gaming laptop, and I put it to the test with a couple of popular games as well as a graphics benchmark test.</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid impact in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite.</p><p> I recorded the internal temperature using NZXT’s CAM app and the external temperature with a infrared thermometer, first with the laptop by itself. After it cooled down, I tested again with the cooling pad equipped the whole time.</p><p> In racing game Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade put up an internal processor temperature of 184 degrees Fahrenheit and external temperature of 117 degrees, but peaked at 169 degrees internal and 107 degrees external with the Kootek pad equipped. The average frame rate was nearly identical between tests, with no significant difference from the use of the cooling pad.</p><p> Meanwhile, I saw a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees when playing Fortnite, along with an external temperature of 118 degrees. With the cooling pad equipped, I saw a slightly lower internal peak of 192 degrees, although it mostly hovered in the 160 to 170-degree range during testing. The external peak with the Kootek pad was 106 degrees. Curiously, I saw the exact same numbers with the Heaven graphics benchmark test with and without the cooling pad: 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees external.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ppFnQ9kEpjbEV9cYbHzLRI5j-j8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_05-4a4d5ee065a94c3e984ae0c96f4916d8.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid effort in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite, although the cheaper, dual-fan TopMate C302 cooling pad saw slightly better overall results. Your experience may vary depending on your laptop of choice, however. All the while, the Kootek pad stayed pretty quiet in stark contrast to the Razer Blade’s own very loud internal fans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Entirely-reasonable"><a href="#Price-Entirely-reasonable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Entirely reasonable"></a>Price: Entirely reasonable</h2><p> At $26 from Amazon, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops. There are cheaper options out there, as well as some with additional features such as temperature sensors and additional fan controls, but Kootek’s device delivers good functionality for the price.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/30UKekQcQjJ1mpixthV5avHNZsE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_02-9e1418002e754b2c8e01cb12f766975a.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134495/18498" target="_top" id="2134495">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134495" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134495/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad-vs-TopMate-C302"><a href="#Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad-vs-TopMate-C302" class="headerlink" title="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad vs. TopMate C302"></a>Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad vs. TopMate C302</h2><p> As mentioned above, the TopMate C302 is a lighter, simpler cooling pad option. It’s designed for laptops up to 15 inches in size and isn’t quite as thick or heavy, but it gets the job done with effective cooling and straightforward design. Kootek’s pad offers an additional USB port for accessories, though, and allows for more height variance than the TopMate’s basic pop-out feet.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A good all-around option.</strong></p><p> A clunky design makes the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad a bit awkward in use, but ultimately it does a solid job of cooling hot laptops and accommodating larger-sized devices. The extra USB ports are handy, especially for port-limited laptops, and the price is reasonable.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/north-face-pivoter-backpack-review-4690198" >North Face Pivoter Backpack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Laptop Cooling Pad</li><li>Product Brand  Kootek</li><li>MPN  LCP05</li><li>Price  $35.99</li><li>Release Date  August 2018</li><li>Weight  2.91 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  15 x 11.8 x 1.4 in.</li><li>Color  Blue, Red</li><li>Ports  USB-A x2</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-digital-decor-best-platforms-and-software-for-photo-frameups-for-2024/"><u>[New] Digital Decor Best Platforms & Software for Photo Frameups for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-exclusive-charger-kits-for-gopro-hero5-official-and-alternative-models/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Exclusive Charger Kits for GoPro Hero5 – Official & Alternative Models</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-highlights-the-5-most-advanced-low-speed-recorders/"><u>[Updated] Highlights The 5 Most Advanced Low-Speed Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-full-hd-on-facebook-streams/"><u>2024 Approved Unlocking Full HD on Facebook Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/from-console-to-handheld-why-you-should-try-the-steam-deck/"><u>From Console to Handheld: Why You Should Try the Steam Deck</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-rescue-lost-videos-from-magic-5-by-fonelab-android-recover-video/"><u>How to Rescue Lost Videos from Magic 5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/review-of-wireless-headphones-the-m06-model/"><u>Review of Wireless Headphones - The M06 Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/score-the-best-prices-for-benq-monitors-and-projectors-this-prime-day/"><u>Score the Best Prices for BenQ Monitors and Projectors This Prime Day</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/stateless-address-autoconfiguration-slaac-simplifies-address-assignment-on-ipv6-networks-without-a-dhcp-server/"><u>Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) Simplifies Address Assignment on IPv6 Networks without a DHCP Server</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/tech-insight-the-unassuming-powerhouse-inside-tcls-32s325-roku-smart-led-2019-model-review/"><u>Tech Insight: The Unassuming Powerhouse Inside TCL's 32S325 Roku Smart LED (2019 Model Review)</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re on a budget and in the market for a dashboard camera, the Apeman C450 is a worthy consideration. For under $50, it captures smooth, detailed video in full 1080p HD resolution. It’s easy to use (even though the user manual is substandard) and it won’t give you any problems during the drive. It does have a few points of frustration, but that shouldn’t be a shock at this price point—it’s hard to make a truly good dashcam for this cheap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wyf8r7L4gDINa5Etodv7VR7ogds=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_03-3a8b995526fe491b9634a885db40804a.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-All-the-basics"><a href="#Design-All-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Design: All the basics"></a><strong>Design: All the basics</strong></h2><p> The Apeman C450 has a three-inch screen that’s bright, detailed, and provides an at-a-glance view of the camera’s status. If it were much bigger, it would be both a distraction and dangerous visual obstruction.</p><p> The camera comes with both a suction cup (which attaches to the windshield) and a dash mount, so there are two different options for setting it up in your car. Power supply options include a USB cord and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/finding-the-right-12v-usb-adapter-534755" >12V adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (the kind that plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter). The 12V adapter has a built in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is very convenient if you don’t have one in your car—it can not only power up the dashcam but also your smartphone or other device.</p><p> It scratches easily, parts fall off, and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it.</p><p> The controls on this dashboard camera are a bit counterintuitive. The fact that the navigation and “OK” buttons are on opposite sides means you must use two hands to navigate the menu. We found ourselves constantly hitting the menu button when we meant to hit “OK”, which was pretty frustrating and generally a poor design.</p><p> One big thing to note about this dashcam is that it’s not very durable. It scratches easily, parts fall off (more on that later), and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it. For example, we kept the protective plastic attached to the display during part of our testing, and when we removed it, the screen got a big scratch within the first minute, just from setting it down on a piece of wooden furniture.</p><p> This car camera stores video on a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There isn’t one included, so you’ll have to buy one. And while Apeman claims that the maximum size is 32GB, we tried out a 64GB card and it worked just fine—we filled it up to capacity and didn’t notice any problems with the device or the footage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A63ztrIxThbZlrb_lHJH3YL7778=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_02-6ef4e204d0bd452b9601ec468e5358bf.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135404/19272" target="_top" id="2135404">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135404" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135404/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself"></a><strong>Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself</strong></h2><p> The user manual included with the Apeman C450 isn’t particularly useful, and though its written in English, the language is full of confusing phrases that feel like poor translations. The features are not fully explained and there are key omissions in the instructions that make understanding and using this dashcam much harder.</p><p> The main thing to set up is the mount in your car. The Apeman C450 comes with both a suction cup and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-car-gps-trackers-4158961" >dash mount, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and fortunately it’s easy to attach both. The suction cup sticks firmly on your windshield via a simple locking knob, and once it’s attached, it’s not going anywhere. We had our test unit attached to a windshield for four days and it never failed.</p><p> One thing to note about the suction cup is that the bolt and pin that hold the hinge together come off very easily. During our testing, ours got away from us within the first few hours—the bolt fell off and the pin disappeared into the ether. We eventually found the bolt again, but the pin never reemerged.</p><p> Since there are no extra parts included in the box, the suction cup instantly became useless. After a failed trip to the hardware store, we just had to stick a cotter pin through the hole to keep the hinge attached. Consider this a warning: keep an eye on all the parts when you’re assembling this dashcam.</p><p> As an alternative, the mount can also be stuck to your dashboard with an adhesive strip. Just make sure you place it in the right spot the first time or you risk losing some of the stickiness. One benefit the dash mount has over the suction cup is that it doesn’t take up any real estate on your windshield that may obstruct your view of traffic.</p><p> Your first time using the Apeman C450, you also have the option to set up a time and date stamp as well as a car identification number on your videos. This is a nice option to keep track of when a video was recorded, and which car it was recorded from if you have more than one camera in different vehicles.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139116/17108" target="_top" id="2139116">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139116" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139116/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device</strong></h2><p> You can set this dashcam to capture video in 1080p, 720p, and VGA resolution. That’s impressive for a camera this size, and Apeman puts 1080p Full HD front and center in their marketing materials. While it provides a good level of detail and clarity in the video, it’s worth noting that other dashcams out there can record in resolutions up to 1440p.</p><p> The camera also has the ability to record audio, but it’s an internal mic and not very directional so it picks up everything. When we tested it, we heard a lot of engine and wind noise while driving. Voices came through alright, but it’s not a high-quality recording and didn’t pick up anything happening outside the vehicle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Hp7FvJ_BMgl0S2-Dsd-hd2qiQ7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_04-82d0af63043344a6b7b44863790050d7.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them"><a href="#Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them"></a><strong>Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them</strong></h2><p> During our testing, the Apeman C450 performed exactly as we expected. It never shut down unexpectedly, it stayed attached to the windshield, and it yielded no problems during the drive.</p><p> We reviewed the video on a high-definition screen and it was as clear as can be expected from a camera this size. When traveling at freeway speeds there was some motion blur and pixelation and we couldn’t make out small details like license plate numbers or read billboards clearly. However, when the car was on smaller streets and back roads, the details got much better.</p><p> When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten.</p><p> The Apeman C450 records video with a 170-degree FOV (field of view). This is great because it captures the whole view from your windshield, rather than just a portion of it. This wide angle produces a slight fish-eye effect, but it isn’t distracting and would be easy to fix with the right video editing software should you ever need to.</p><p> This dashcam also employs loop recording, meaning that it is constantly recording, but splits up the recording in one-, three- or five-minute chunks for review. The camera automatically overwrites older recordings when your memory card is full. You can also turn loop recording off if you want a full, uninterrupted video file of your drive.</p><p> Playback Mode allowed us to watch the videos we recorded, deleted unwanted ones, and lock any that we didn’t want to be overwritten. Playback Mode is functional as far as it goes, but if you want the best detail possible, you’ll have to watch your footage on a display bigger than three inches.</p><p> The C450 also comes equipped with a G-sensor that enables it to detect collisions. When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten. This ensures you can prove who is at fault in a traffic incident to police or insurance companies. This dashcam also has a “Parking Guard” mode that behaves like a motion detection security camera for your car. However, this requires a special power supply since the battery won’t last long when not connected to power.</p><p> If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution.</p><p> One thing to note about this car dashboard camera is that the battery life is quite short. When we tested the Apeman C450, it powered down 28 minutes after we unplugged it. If you want continuous recording, it must be connected to power at all times.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1061528/11832" target="_top" id="1061528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1061528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1061528/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable even on a budget"></a><strong>Price: Affordable even on a budget</strong></h2><p> The defects of this dashcam can be forgiven pretty easily considering that it costs less than $50. If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution—it’s definitely not built as solidly and lacks the high resolution of its more expensive competitors, but if you are comfortable working around those shortcomings, this dashcam performs pretty well for the price.</p><h2 id="Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus"><a href="#Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus"></a><strong>Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus</strong></h2><p> We tested the Apeman C450 side by side with the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam. The Z3 Plus is considerably more expensive, and while we found these two devices to be generally similar in form and function, we ultimately favored the Z3 Plus because it lacks the small annoyances that made the Apeman C450 frustrating.</p><p> The interface and navigation controls on the Z3 Plus are smoother, it has higher resolution capacities, and we didn’t have a problem with components falling apart within a day of it arriving in the mail. It’s definitely pricier (usually $70 to $80 more expensive than the Apeman), but we think the improved quality of the camera and the better-looking video it produces make it a worthwhile upgrade for those who can afford it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A decent budget dashcam with some flaws that are annoying but not necessarily deal-breaking.</strong></p><p> Despite a poor-quality build and some design quirks, the Apeman C450 does its job as a dashcam. It has a discreet design, captures pretty good-quality video, and has important extra features like collision detection and a surveillance mode. If you can get past some of its foibles, it’s definitely worth the price tag.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139111/17108" target="_top" id="2139111">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139111" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139111/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ddpai-mini3-review-4770579" >DDpai mini3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/rexing-v1-dashcam-review-4770571" >Rexing V1 DashCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/anker-roav-dashcam-c1-review-4773139" >Anker Roav DashCam C1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484939/16446" target="_top" id="1484939">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484939" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484939/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C450 Dash Cam</li><li>Product Brand  Apeman</li><li>MPN  X0023JN4OL</li><li>Price  $39.99</li><li>Weight  12 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.3 x 4.2 x 3.8 in.</li><li>Camera  170-degree FOV, WDR</li><li>Recording Quality  1080p</li><li>Crash Detection  Yes</li><li>Parking Mode  Yes</li><li>Connectivity options  USB</li><li>Storage  Up to 32GB SDHC card (Class 10)</li><li>Warranty  12 months</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-creative-edge-in-tiktok-two-effect-adding-methods/"><u>[New] In 2024, Creative Edge in TikTok Two Effect-Adding Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-optimize-video-quality-on-youtube-with-size-settings/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Optimize Video Quality on YouTube with Size Settings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-privacy-preservation-how-to-make-faces-invisible-online/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Privacy Preservation How to Make Faces Invisible Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-apples-podcast-library-a-download-guide/"><u>2024 Approved Unlocking Apple's Podcast Library A Download Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-useful-tips-and-apps-for-taking-amazing-android-photography/"><u>2024 Approved Useful Tips and Apps for Taking Amazing Android Photography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-analysis-of-overwatchs-compelling-competitive-gameplay-mechanics/"><u>A Comprehensive Analysis of Overwatch's Compelling Competitive Gameplay Mechanics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/a-minimalist-approach-to-alien-stories-by-aminy/"><u>A Minimalist Approach to Alien Stories by Aminy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/a-powerful-zoom-compact-camera-reviewed-the-sx720hs-examined/"><u>A Powerful Zoom Compact Camera Reviewed: The SX720HS Examined</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/acer-aspire-e-15-excelling-in-value-for-money-your-go-to-pick-for-budget-friendly-power-on-the-move/"><u>Acer Aspire E 15 -

No, it wasn’t the most powerful headset out there, using a two-year-old smartphone processor to power its games and experiences, but it was a capable, completely self-contained, wireless VR headset that didn’t require a PC or game console to deliver stellar immersion.</p><p> It was one of last year’s greatest new gadgets, and now Oculus has returned with a sequel. The Oculus Quest 2 is smaller and lighter, yet more powerful and with a much better screen—yet it costs $100 less than the original. How did that happen? Well, it’s not all great news, thanks to a couple of cost-cutting measures that you’ll feel and potentially see, but the end result is ultimately a better and more affordable device that serves as an ideal gateway into VR.</p><h2 id="Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made"><a href="#Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made" class="headerlink" title="Design and Comfort: Compromises were made"></a>Design and Comfort: Compromises were made</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 sticks to the familiar modern VR playbook as a module that you strap onto your face to immerse yourself within its digital worlds but features some different material and construction choices than the original. Unfortunately, the design choices largely are not upgrades compared to the original headset</p><p> Noticeably, the module itself doesn’t jut out as far from your face as before, plus it has a white plastic finish rather than the black fabric-lined exterior of the original. It also weighs less, which is a good thing for a device that hangs off of your face: it comes in at 503g compared to 571g with the original Quest.</p><p> However, the shallower depth of the module makes an impact for someone like me who must wear glasses while using the Quest 2.</p><p> Even with the included, optional glasses spacer, which adds a couple extra millimeters between the lenses and where the padded visor presses against your face, the inside felt much tighter against my glasses. It can be tricky to get the Quest 2 on without my eyelashes brushing against my lenses.</p><p> But that’s also due in part to the new fabric strap system, which is less effective than the rubber, dome-like strap from the first Quest. That previous strap did a better job of cupping the back of your head to offset the weight of the module itself and keep it comfortably strapped to your head, but these loose, adjustable fabric straps aren’t nearly as secure. It took me longer to get the headset on and in a comfortable position, and I couldn’t find the same kind of sweet spot as before.</p><p> Oculus now sells a $49 Elite Strap attachment that’s more akin to the original Quest strap, and while the Quest 2 straps are usable, I’ll probably make the upgrade and buy the better strap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JkgQv_Sk0ofSL0Sp-jKmqe84xak=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-2-a7792535288542dba45c8bc32f882be2.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Rift 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137395/7443" target="_top" id="2137395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137395/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks"><a href="#Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks"></a>Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 uses the same kind of “inside-out” tracking system that relies on four cameras on the visor to track the wireless controllers or even your hands, rather than relying on external tracking sensors as some PC-based systems do. Like the original, it works amazingly well, allowing for fluid, six-degrees-of-freedom movement in games and minimizing both initial setup and the time it takes to get going each session. It also means that you can use the Oculus Quest 2_anywhere_ without the need for any kind of external hardware or accessories.</p><p> The Quest 2’s wireless, motion-sensing Oculus Touch controllers are identical in function to the original, but are a little heavier and have a larger surface with space to rest your thumb when not in use. That’s handy. Each has an analog stick and two face buttons, along with a trigger button and a grip button. Oculus also swapped out the magnetically-attached battery doors from the first Quest controllers—which would sometimes slide open when I used the original—for ones that simply click into place. That’s a win for function over form.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1aG6kdNHMuvnim8p8_i1RwH9QG8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-3-eec6cabc11db4ed9be5254aa2bc46ec1.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123726/7443" target="_top" id="2123726">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123726" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123726/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> But there is a potential loss for function and comfort with one other particular aspect of the headset itself: IPD adjustment. Inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is the physical distance between your eyes, and a headset must account for it to effectively deliver clear, 3D experiences. On the original Quest, a physical slider let you precisely adjust the distance to match your own face. With the Quest 2, however, there are just three settings, and you can physically shift the placement of the lenses to choose the position that is closest to your own.</p><p> If your IPD matches or is very close to one of the settings (58mm, 63mm, 68mm), then you’re all set. If not, then you may notice that the image isn’t as clear as you’d like, and it could potentially lead to headaches if you can’t find a pretty good sweet spot. In my case, my IPD is close enough to the middle setting to be OK, but it doesn’t feel as spot-on as it did on the original Quest using the slider. It might help knock down the price of the headset, but that’s a quality-of-life downgrade that will affect some people significantly more than others.</p><p> That might sound like a lot of griping, but it’s only because some of the key physical design changes on the Quest 2 feel like compromises or downgrades. But for most people, they won’t be significant impediments. And if you’re coming to the new headset without ever using the original Quest, then you should be fine—the new straps are usable, but they aren’t as effective or effortlessly adjustable as before. Luckily, the Quest 2 makes significant strides elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gwWuuSfTzWNDoS45b-iG9qG32-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-4-27f169e7e71b4372a38e13332b7b1364.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook"></a>Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook</h2><p> You should charge the Oculus Quest 2 out of the box, as the modest total battery life means a partially-charged headset isn’t going to last very long. You will need a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , either Android or iPhone, and the free Oculus app to complete setup, as well. Once the headset has a good charge, begin setup from the mobile app and then follow the guided directions, which will involve putting on, adjusting, and getting familiar with the headset itself.</p><p> Part of the setup process, and the process each time you use the headset, is to designate your play space by “drawing” a barrier within the augmented view of your surroundings seen through the headset’s cameras. From there, the headset determines whether you have enough space for active, room-scale experiences, or you can choose a stationary setup for seated play modes. During active play, a virtual barrier called the Oculus Guardian appears when you get close to the edges of your designated play space to help you avoid crashing into your surroundings. It’s all rather clever and effective.</p><p> There’s one other potential hitch with the Oculus Quest 2 that wasn’t present with the original: the new headset_requires_ a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tutorial-how-facebook-works-2654610" >Facebook account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and there’s no way around it. Facebook owns Oculus, and while the first Quest could be used simply with an Oculus account, the new one requires the social media account. For some, that may be a deal-breaker, given frustrations over privacy and the increasing role that Facebook plays in our society, so just know that going in.</p><h2 id="Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade"><a href="#Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It’s a big upgrade"></a>Performance: It’s a big upgrade</h2><p> The original Oculus Quest did a fine job of delivering immersive VR experiences that didn’t feel compromised or significantly downgraded, even if it didn’t hit the same visual peaks as pricier, PC-powered headsets. And it was pretty amazing that the Quest did so with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, a chip found in 2017’s flagship smartphones.</p><p> The Oculus Quest 2 takes things to another level, and there are a few reasons why.</p><p> First off, the new Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chip here is based on the current Snapdragon 865 chip seen in phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Note20, and is three generations newer than the old chip.</p><p> It’s also paired with 50 percent more RAM (6GB) than the original Quest. Even more vividly, the fast-switching LCD screen packs in nearly 50 percent more pixels per eye than the old OLED panels did, for a noticeably crisper and smoother experience.</p><p> On the first Quest, you got 1440x1600 resolution per eye: solid, but a bit fuzzy and comparatively lower resolution than some of the PC headsets on the market. Here, however, the single screen provides 1832x1920 per eye, and the difference is obvious. While the switch from OLED to LCD technology should weaken the contrast a bit and dampen the deep black levels, I’ll be honest: I didn’t notice.</p><p> What I did notice was sharper interfaces and smoother action, with more fluid-feeling experiences that exhibited fewer of the occasional-yet-tolerable hitches seen with some games and apps on the first Quest headset.</p><p> Additionally, Oculus recently enabled the Quest 2 to hit a peak 90Hz screen refresh rate, up from 72Hz on the first headset, which will only help deliver that smoother-feeling usage. Developers must enable 90Hz within their apps and games, however.</p><p> I felt the Quest 2’s enhancements more prominently in some games over others. Laser sword-swinging music game Beat Saber, for example, ran well on the first headset and isn’t that different here—just smoother and clearer-looking. But with the online battle royale shooter Population: One, the cleaner-looking textures and more fluid performance helped mitigate some of the light motion sickness I felt playing on the first Quest.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones"></a>Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones</h2><p> Plugging in headphones delivers a more closed-off, immersive experience, but the Oculus Quest 2’s built-in speaker does a solid job of delivering audio and music. It does sound a tiny bit louder and fuller than the original Quest’s speaker, but not significantly so. Still, if you want to play without being fully shut-off from your surroundings, it works just fine.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657396/16446" target="_top" id="1657396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657396/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours"><a href="#Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours" class="headerlink" title="Battery: You’ll get a couple hours"></a>Battery: You’ll get a couple hours</h2><p> Like the original headset, the Oculus Quest 2 is rated for 2-3 hours of usage on a full charge. For such a compact, standalone headset, I think that’s reasonable. You get a couple hours to play, and then you can take a breather and do other things while it charges.</p><p> That said, if you’re keen on longer-lasting experiences, Oculus sells a $129 version of the Elite Strap with a built-in battery pack that doubles the play time, or you can get a portable battery pack, plug it in, and stick it in your pocket during use. Lastly, you could just use a lengthy USB-C cable and plug yourself into a wall. If you’re doing room-scale VR games and apps with free movement, however, you’ll need something longer—like 10 feet or more. Otherwise, some seated apps and games will work just fine when you’re tethered to a nearby wall outlet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ns2S3DQVema5UEDDSO8n3N7SC_4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-7-0a0e40b6a3064fe7abc985f0900dbeff.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC"><a href="#Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC" class="headerlink" title="Software: Use the headset or connect to PC"></a>Software: Use the headset or connect to PC</h2><p> The headset’s own interface hasn’t changed much from the first Quest, taking place in a 3D home-like environment with floating menus that you can access via the motion controllers. It’s a pretty easy way to choose between your currently installed games and apps, install anything else in your library, purchase and download new content, and access video content including apps like Netflix, YouTube, and SlingTV.</p><p> Oculus has also enabled optional hand tracking, including the use of hand and finger gestures to get around the interface and interact with some games. Hand tracking is definitely more finicky than using the controllers, however, and you’ll need solid lighting to really rely on it. That said, it does still feel experimental, and I encountered enough misread gestures and incorrect interactions to make me want to stick to the controllers. They work reliably great.</p><p> Since the original Quest’s launch, Oculus added the ability to connect the headset to a powerful PC to run more advanced VR experiences, and that carries over to the Quest 2, as well. You’ll need a PC that is capable of running headsets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as either the official Oculus Link USB-C cable ($80) or a comparable USB 3.1 cable that can handle the high-speed demands. I bought an unofficial cable for half the price on Amazon, and it worked great.</p><p> Using a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, I was able to play the visually demanding and deeply immersive Half-Life: Alyx on the Oculus Quest 2—a game that it could never run using its own internal hardware. It ran a little less smoothly than it did using the PC-native Valve Index headset, but not significantly so. This is a great way to experience higher-end VR games, including the new<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/star-wars-squadrons-review-5086656" >Star Wars: Squadrons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , for example. And with Oculus announcing plans to phase out PC-only headsets, it will also be a key part of the Quest platform’s future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/72vxixVr7kdKoLfUC3QkIrBl26I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-6-12fcb6054cf2475191bc613a3f26bcfc.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The $299 edition of the headset comes with 64GB of internal storage and the $399 version nets you 256GB, with some of each tally taken up by system software and resources. Luckily, the games and apps themselves aren’t huge, typically weighing in between 1-4GB apiece, sometimes less, and they’re pretty quick to download again if you want to revisit something. The 64GB edition should provide enough space for most players, as you could probably comfortably have a dozen or more games installed, along with streaming media apps, but anyone who wants to have a robust VR library on hand at all times without waiting might consider spending the extra cash.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983584">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983584.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983584">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983584.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983584%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983584/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Games-A-good-growing-selection"><a href="#Games-A-good-growing-selection" class="headerlink" title="Games: A good, growing selection"></a>Games: A good, growing selection</h2><p> Although those aforementioned games and some others are still only found on PC (or maybe PlayStation VR on the PlayStation 4 or 5), the Oculus Quest platform has amassed a very nice selection of native games that you can download and play right on the headset.There is no difference in compatibility between the headsets: all Quest games play on Quest 2 and vice versa, just with performance differences.</p><p> Many of the early games from the impressive Quest launch lineup are still among the best games you can play on the Quest 2. The aforementioned Beat Saber, which finds you swinging your controllers to slash faux lightsabers through soaring rhythmic beats, is a frenetic blast, now with a larger library of songs including BTS and Linkin Park packs. Superhot VR is a stylish hybrid of a shooter and a puzzle game, of sorts, as you figure out how to clear through foes while avoiding incoming bullets that only move when you do. Meanwhile, the Star Wars VR game Vader Immortal still does a great job of creating an authentic atmosphere.</p><p> But there’s so much more now, too. Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite, both from developer Enhance Games, are trippy, trancelike experiences that you can sit down and really savor in VR. Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners and the aforementioned Population: One show that larger-scale shooter experiences can be immersive and compelling in VR, plus there’s a newer Star Wars game, Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge, that blends interactive storytelling with fun blaster battles.</p><p> There’s a lot of great stuff on Quest 2, ranging from simple arcade-like experiences to larger-scale adventures, quirky interactive experiences, and more. And on top of that, there are the aforementioned video services for 360-degree videos, plus fitness apps and games, VR chat for communicating with friends and random people, a web browser, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FqVvo044zoPghSD_PR1g2e0L2rs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-5-216bbf638cbe407b8b6f332abc94ae47.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Price-It’s-an-amazing-value"><a href="#Price-It’s-an-amazing-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s an amazing value"></a>Price: It’s an amazing value</h2><p> The Oculus Quest was already impressively priced at $399, so launching the more powerful Oculus Quest 2 at $299 is pretty phenomenal. Granted, the design compromises are a little frustrating, and I would’ve rather paid more for a better strap and more precise IPD settings like on the original—but those are the tweaks made to try and broaden the market for the Quest and VR as a whole. Still, even with those design annoyances, the Quest 2 is an incredible value for a portable, fully self-contained VR game console.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TDsFPvRGkhZaFzIaNnKRk1_xO4s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-8-Comparison-1b0c51b029da41389167e103a4c4843a.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815679/21290" target="_top" id="1815679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815679/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR"></a>Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR</h2><p> Amazingly, there is no direct analog to the Oculus Quest 2 on the market: Oculus seems to be the only company that can release such a powerful device at this kind of price and with this kind of software support. That said, if I had to compare it to another VR headset, I’d put it up against Sony’s PlayStation VR, which requires a PlayStation 4 or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> console.</p><p> The PSVR is a few years old now and is technically overshadowed by the Quest 2 in terms of screen and controller quality. Still, Sony has amassed some stellar exclusive games thanks to its partnerships with game developers, and the PlayStation VR is a solid, reasonably affordable pickup for anyone who already has a PS4 or PS5 console and wants to dabble in VR. But if you don’t already have the console, and you want to get into VR, go for the dedicated Quest 2 instead. It’ll be cheaper than buying a headset and console together, plus it’s a better VR experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-vr-review-4692684" >Sony PlayStation VR Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The best VR device, all things considered.</strong></p><p> The significant performance upgrade and surprising price drop outweigh some of the annoying design shifts with the Oculus Quest 2, making it the must-have VR headset for just about everyone. Not only does it play a great library of on-headset games, but it can also connect to a powerful PC to play even more games on top of that. Add to that the ease of use, quality gameplay, and immersive visuals, and the Oculus Quest 2 is another brilliant VR game console.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-rift-s-review-4764112" >Oculus Rift S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-go-vr-headset-review-4690298" >Oculus Go Standalone VR Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Quest 2</li><li>Product Brand  Meta</li><li>UPC  815820021292</li><li>Price  $299.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2020</li><li>Weight  1.1 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.54 x 5.61 x 4.02 in.</li><li>Color  Gray</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Android 10</li><li>Processor  Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2</li><li>RAM  6GB</li><li>Storage  64GB&#x2F;256GB</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-3-techniques-to-retrieve-and-save-youtubes-iconic-images/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved 3 Techniques to Retrieve & Save YouTube's Iconic Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-affordable-gopros-where-to-buy-with-best-price/"><u>[New] Affordable GoPros Where to Buy with Best Price</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-refining-reality-close-up-creations-in-minecraft/"><u>[Updated] Refining Reality Close-Up Creations in Minecraft</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/amazon-halo-review-the-unorthodox-and-thoroughly-detailed-wellness-monitor/"><u>Amazon Halo Review: The Unorthodox and Thoroughly Detailed Wellness Monitor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/dash-and-go-robotics-the-ultimate-review-of-the-wonderful-innovative-dash-playset/"><u>Dash & Go Robotics – The Ultimate Review of the Wonderful, Innovative Dash Playset</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/discover-the-premier-wireless-mice-on-the-market-in-2ebydoeptime2024/"><u>Discover the Premier Wireless Mice on the Market in 2Ebydoeptime2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/diy-guide-set-up-your-own-portable-display-with-the-msi-pro-mp161-e2/"><u>DIY Guide: Set Up Your Own Portable Display with the MSI Pro MP161 E2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/exploring-the-microsoft-surface-go-a-budget-friendly-tablet-struggling-with-its-purpose/"><u>Exploring the Microsoft Surface Go: A Budget-Friendly Tablet Struggling with Its Purpose</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/fix-common-problems-with-oculus-air-link-on-windows-expert-advice-and-solutions/"><u>Fix Common Problems with Oculus Air Link on Windows - Expert Advice & Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/get-up-close-with-the-new-apple-iphone-15-pro-a-hands-on-review/"><u>Get Up Close with the New Apple iPhone 15 Pro: A Hands-On Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/getting-the-pokemon-go-gps-signal-not-found-11-error-in-samsung-galaxy-a34-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>Getting the Pokemon Go GPS Signal Not Found 11 Error in Samsung Galaxy A34 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-premier-7-phone-apps-for-changing-tone-quality/"><u>In 2024, Premier 7 Phone Apps for Changing Tone Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-6-appsservices-to-trace-any-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-4g-location-by-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 6 Apps/Services to Trace Any Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 4G Location By Mobile Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-is-fake-gps-location-pro-and-is-it-good-on-vivo-y02t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, What is Fake GPS Location Pro and Is It Good On Vivo Y02T?

Read on for our full take.</em></p><p> Nvidia’s RTX 30 series is the hottest thing in PC gaming right now. So hot, in fact, that it’s almost impossible to buy a desktop RTX 30 series graphics card, and even laptops with the hardware are flying off store shelves.</p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is, in many respects, a mid-range gaming laptop, but it succeeds at one very important task: it delivers Nvidia RTX 3060 Max-Q at a reasonable price, and it’s actually in stock not just at, but sometimes below, MSRP. Its value pricing helps the Triton 300 SE stand out against attractive competitors like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.</p><h2 id="Design-Small-but-sturdy"><a href="#Design-Small-but-sturdy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small but sturdy"></a>Design: Small but sturdy</h2><p> I’m surprised Acer didn’t slap a “Pro” label on the Predator Triton 300 SE. The spec sheet might scream gaming, but the laptop’s look and feel has more in common with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >business laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The aluminum exterior and simple silver interior keep this laptop subtle. It’s a bit dull, actually, compared to the sleek elegance of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-book-13-review-5176895" >Razer’s Book 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the brash look of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The Triton 300 SE measures 0.7 inches thick and weighs a hair less than 3.5 pounds. These figures aren’t unusual in 2021 but are impressive for a laptop packing serious gaming horsepower. It will easily fit in most backpacks or messenger bags, yet packs performance to rival modern game consoles.</p><p> It’s a sturdy little beast, too. The chassis feels slate-like in hand. Holding the laptop up by one corner reveals nearly no flex. The display is the weak point; opening the laptops can cause a few creaks and groans.</p><p> Physical connectivity is a mix of new and old. There are two USB-A 3.2 ports paired with a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port that supports DisplayPort Mode and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713" >Thunderbolt 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There’s also an HDMI output and a 3.5mm audio jack that handles audio-in and out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RkOepytb4JglYF6g8lqap4lR4Uk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-5-b8c978f2d42a4865be1ea11a4785c104.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> All the laptop’s ports are placed near the front of the chassis. You’ll have to deal with tangled cables more often than with a laptop that places most ports on the rear. I found this annoying when using an external mouse, as cables jutting from the laptop’s flanks often bumped my hand while playing games.</p><h2 id="What’s-New-This-one-is-special"><a href="#What’s-New-This-one-is-special" class="headerlink" title="What’s New: This one is special"></a>What’s New: This one is special</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE has little in common with other Predator Triton or Helios models.

It’s not especially bright and has a matte coating, so lacks the brilliant, eye-catching look that is common to high-end laptops with glossy, high-brightness displays.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop. I noticed this in every game I played.</p><p> Once I loaded a game, though, I liked what I saw. The screen’s resolution is 1080p, but that’s more than enough to provide a sharp, crisp look in modern games. It also supports a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-refresh-rate-2625984" >maximum refresh rate of 144Hz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , providing an ultra-smooth look in older titles capable of achieving a high framerate.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop.

It’s odd because it has just four cores (running eight threads) but is still sold as a top-tier component. The Core i7-11375H has higher minimum and maximum clock speeds than the comparable Intel Core i7-1165G7 found in thinner notebooks. The i7-11375H can clock as high as 5GHz. My review unit also had 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid-state hard drive.</p><p> PCMark 10 hit an overall score of 5,534. Geekbench 5 turned in a single-core score of 1,418 and a multi-core score of 4,493. The Geekbench 5 multi-core score is behind the curve;<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amd-vs-intel-which-processor-is-best-for-you-4780276" >new AMD Ryzen 7 5000-series laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can almost double that result. This will disappoint content creators who use CPU-dependent applications. The Acer Triton 300 SE won’t keep up with AMD-powered rivals, like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, in such workloads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_blPSVdy574t15clSGhbK6JH68o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-4-5a097b76e29b4ee985eee421ed6d0fe8.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925489/19272" target="_top" id="1925489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925489/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> Gaming performance proved more impressive. 3DMark Fire Strike hit a score of 14,462, while Time Spy hit a score of 6,721. The laptop averaged 143 FPS in the GFXBench Car Chase test. It also averaged 74 frames per second in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at high detail with ray-traced shadows off.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ray-tracing-5097484" >Turning ray-traced shadows on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reduced the average to 56 frames per second.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution.</p><p> These numbers may seem disappointing if compared to all RTX 3060 laptops. You can expect more from Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 and the Razer Blade 15. But don’t forget the price. Acer’s laptop significantly undercuts those alternatives.

I wouldn’t recommend the Triton 300 SE if you plan to use an external 1440p or 4K monitor, however. Pushing a higher pixel count will lead to sub-60fps performance in most demanding games.</p><h2 id="Productivity-All-business"><a href="#Productivity-All-business" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: All business"></a>Productivity: All business</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s business-like design carries over to the keyboard and mouse. Key feel is good, with significant key travel and firm bottoming action, and the spacious layout will be comfortable for most users.</p><p> There is a flaw: some keys are smaller than they could be. The Control, Function, and Windows keys are noticeable examples. It’s an odd decision that can cause confusion when hunting for a keyboard shortcut.</p><p> Keyboard backlighting is standard and set to white by default, but the color can be customized across three zones. It’s not as impressive as the per-key RGB backlighting found on some gaming laptops but I’m happy to see some customization offered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IiMzYmVU-_I6PnObn0bkjyCzqUk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-3-7cae0e5d13154048bbc93c40976706ca.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137225/26400" target="_top" id="2137225">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137225" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137225/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S.

Video quality is grainy in all but the brightest rooms and uneven lighting can easily confuse it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997630/19272" target="_top" id="1997630">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997630" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997630/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Ouch"><a href="#Battery-Ouch" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Ouch"></a>Battery: Ouch</h2><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story. This is a powerful laptop yet, due to its size, it contains a modest 60 watt-hour battery. That would be fine in a laptop without discrete graphics, but this is a gaming laptop.</p><p> I didn’t expect much endurance and received even less. My first effort at using the Triton 300 SE for a workday of writing had me reaching for the power brick after 3 hours. Two further workdays put me at about 3 hours, 30 minutes each.</p><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story.</p><p> In fairness to Acer, there’s little it could do to fix this issue. A slim gaming laptop sucks down a lot of juice even outside of games, yet there’s not much room for a battery. The majority of gaming laptops I’ve tested in recent years have delivered less than 4 hours of real-world endurance, and the worst won’t last 2 hours.</p><p> Still, buyer beware. The Triton 300 SE might look like a productivity laptop, but its battery life is solidly in the realm of full-blown gaming machines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RSfl2dEVmErlvh3BUUFcxqsbt9w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-2-c5eed4bfe7e44014952b5503566097d9.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><h2 id="Software-Planet-what-now"><a href="#Software-Planet-what-now" class="headerlink" title="Software: Planet what now?"></a>Software: Planet what now?</h2><p> Acer ships the Predator Triton 300 SE with Windows 10 Home. It includes a few touches exclusive to Acer, including a Planet9 wallpaper and a few other icons under the same.</p><p> Despite this, most laptop functions are controlled through the PredatorSense software interface. It can control fan modes, adjust keyboard lighting, and monitor temperatures, among other functions. PredatorSense is not much to look at, but I find it less confusing than the alternatives from Asus and Razer.</p><p> The laptop comes with Norton antivirus installed. It’s eager to remind you of its presence whenever you download a file or visit an unfamiliar website. The antivirus is easy to uninstall, but its presence takes away from what otherwise feels like a special laptop in Acer’s Predator line.</p><h2 id="Price-An-outstanding-value"><a href="#Price-An-outstanding-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: An outstanding value"></a>Price: An outstanding value</h2><p> Acer sells the Predator Triton 300 SE for $1,400, and it sometimes sells for $1,350 at Best Buy. This is an outstanding price for a laptop packing Nvidia’s RTX 3060. There’s only a few competitors with the RTX 3060, such as MSI’s GF65 Thin, that can be purchased for less right now. The MSI GF65 manages to undercut the Triton 300 SE by using an older Intel chip and just 8GB of RAM.</p><h2 id="Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14"><a href="#Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14" class="headerlink" title="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14"></a>Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE and Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 seem to target the same users. They’re both compact, light 14-inch laptops that pack impressive CPU and GPU horsepower. Although great for gamers, they also appeal to content creators seeking an affordable, portable laptop.</p><p> The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 wins out in design and build quality. It’s an attractive, eye-catching laptop that feels more solid than the already respectable Triton 300 SE. The two laptops trade blows in display, keyboard, touchpad, and connectivity, with neither having a significant edge.</p><p> Game performance is similar, but the Asus G14 embraces AMD processors with up to eight cores. A well-equipped G14 will easily trounce the Acer in multi-core processor tests. Game performance is roughly similar when both are configured with an RTX 3060 graphics chip, with the Asus G14 having a slight edge.</p><p> While the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a better laptop overall, price is a factor. The Asus G14 is sold for $1,500 when configured with Nvidia’s RTX 3060 and is harder to find in stock. Paying a bit more for the Asus G14 makes sense to content creators who need its superior processor performance, but gamers could find more value in Acer’s alternative.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Excellent value for an RTX-powered gaming laptop.</strong></p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is an excellent value that has what gamers want: a great gaming experience and a quality display. Its short battery life and mediocre multi-core processor hold it back in everyday use, but the laptop’s competitive price makes these flaws easy to forgive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139123/17108" target="_top" id="2139123">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139123" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139123/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-review-5069584" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-laptop-review-4795686" >Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-4779760" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Predator Triton 300 SE</li><li>Product Brand  Acer</li><li>MPN  PT314-51s-71UU</li><li>Price  $1,399.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2021</li><li>Weight  3.75 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.7 x 9 x 0.7 in.</li><li>Color  Silver</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>Platform  Windows 10</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i7-11375H</li><li>RAM  16GB</li><li>Storage  512GB</li><li>Camera  720p</li><li>Battery Capacity  60 watt-hour</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C 3.2 with DisplayPort mode and ThunderBolt 4, 2x USB-A 3.2, 1x HDMI 2.0, 1x 3.5mm audio jack</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-free-top-12-best-idle-games-you-can-try-on-pc/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved FREE Top 12 Best Idle Games You Can Try on PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-expert-tips-for-capturing-and-saving-igtv-on-handhrani-for-2024/"><u>[New] Expert Tips for Capturing and Saving IGTV on Handhrani for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-youtubes-copyright-rules-simplified-a-non-legal-guide/"><u>[Updated] YouTube's Copyright Rules Simplified A Non-Legal Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-create-captivating-videos-with-free-intros/"><u>2024 Approved Create Captivating Videos with Free Intros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ios-and-android-a-tutorial-for-saving-twitters-animations/"><u>2024 Approved IOS and Android A Tutorial for Saving Twitter's Animations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-voice-driven-technology-evolution-best-speech-recognition-software-for-mac/"><u>2024 Approved Voice-Driven Technology Evolution Best Speech Recognition Software for Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-the-chargetech-super-sized-27000mah-battery-pack-your-ultimate-charging-solution/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to the ChargeTech Super-Sized 27,000mAh Battery Pack -

Its screen is a bit bigger and the phone takes up a little more space in your pocket. However, these differences are minimal and hardly noticeable.</p><p> One difference that might matter to you is the display quality. While the Galaxy S24 Ultra boasts a higher pixel density for sharper visuals (about 11 percent more pixels per inch), the iPhone 15 Pro Max prioritizes color accuracy with its Super Retina XDR display with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091" >OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The iPhone might not have the most pixels per inch, but the colors it displays will be incredibly close to what the creator intended, ideal for tasks like photo editing or graphic design.</p><h2 id="Cameras-The-iPhone-Has-Cinematic-Mode"><a href="#Cameras-The-iPhone-Has-Cinematic-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Cameras: The iPhone Has Cinematic Mode"></a>Cameras: The iPhone Has Cinematic Mode</h2><p> iPhone 15 Pro Max</p><ul><li>Main: 48MP wide &#x2F; 12MP periscope telephoto &#x2F; 12 MP ultrawide &#x2F; 12MP selfie.</li><li>Video: HDR &#x2F; 4K up to 60fps &#x2F; 1080p up to 120fps &#x2F; Dolby Vision HDR (up to 60fps), ProRes.</li><li>Cinematic mode lets you record while blurring the foreground and background.</li></ul><p> Samsung S24 Ultra</p><ul><li>Main: 200MP wide &#x2F; 10MP telephoto &#x2F; 50MP periscope telephoto &#x2F; 12MP ultrawide &#x2F; 12MP selfie.</li><li>Video: Auto-HDR, HDR10+ &#x2F; 8K up to 30fps &#x2F; 4K up to 120fps &#x2F; 1080p up to 240fps.</li><li>Dual Recording lets you use the rear and selfie camera simultaneously.</li></ul><p> The camera systems on these phones take very different approaches. The Galaxy S24 Ultra has a monstrous 200MP main sensor, dwarfing the iPhone 15 Pro Max’s 48MP offering. However, there’s a catch: The S24 Ultra typically outputs 12MP photos by default, combining pixels for better low-light performance. The iPhone might capture slightly more detail in perfect lighting, but the S24 Ultra could shine in dim environments.</p><p> The zoom capabilities also differ. The iPhone features a dedicated 5x optical zoom lens, ideal for getting closer to distant subjects without losing quality. The S24 Ultra relies on a combination of its main sensor and a 5x telephoto lens and adds a 3x telephoto lens for a more versatile mid-range zoom option that the iPhone lacks.</p><p> Each phone also features a unique video mode. The iPhone 15 Pro Max’s Cinematic mode is all about artistic control, using AI to create a shallow depth-of-field effect that mimics high-end cameras; it’s great for a polished, cinematic look. Samsung’s Dual Recording mode focuses on capturing two perspectives at once. It’s ideal for vloggers or anyone who wants to record themselves and the scene at the same time.</p><p> The best camera for you depends on your priorities. If you crave the most detail and zoom power, and Cinematic mode sounds like something you’d enjoy, the iPhone might be the better choice. But if shooting<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/8k-resolution-beyond-4k-1846844" >8K video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and having a variety of zoom options is more important, the S24 Ultra could be a better fit.</p><h2 id="Performance-and-Battery-It’s-Hard-to-Tell-the-Difference"><a href="#Performance-and-Battery-It’s-Hard-to-Tell-the-Difference" class="headerlink" title="Performance and Battery: It’s Hard to Tell the Difference"></a>Performance and Battery: It’s Hard to Tell the Difference</h2><p> iPhone 15 Pro Max</p><ul><li>Apple A17 Pro chipset.</li><li>Wired and wireless charging.</li><li>4,441mAh battery.</li></ul><p> Samsung S24 Ultra</p><ul><li>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset.</li><li>Wired and wireless charging.</li><li>5,000mAh battery.</li></ul><p> Both the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra are performance beasts. Apple equips the iPhone with the A17 Pro chip. Samsung counters with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which could offer a slight edge in raw multi-tasking power due to its 12 GB of RAM compared to the iPhone’s 8 GB.</p><p> However, real-world performance differences between these processors are often negligible for everyday tasks. Where the iPhone might shine is in its software optimization. Apple tightly controls both hardware and software, leading to a smooth and efficient user experience.</p><p> Battery life is another close call. The S24 Ultra boasts a larger 5,000mAh battery compared to the iPhone’s 4,441mAh. In theory, this could translate to longer endurance on the S24 Ultra.</p><p> However, Apple’s iPhones are known for their excellent software optimization, which can significantly improve battery efficiency. Also, the iPhone’s display, while beautiful, might use slightly less power than the S24 Ultra’s high-resolution panel.</p><p> Ultimately, real-world battery life will depend on individual usage patterns. Both phones will likely offer a full day’s charge for most users, with the S24 Ultra potentially lasting a bit longer for heavy users.</p><p> The deciding factor here might be charging speed. Samsung advertises the S24 Ultra as being able to hit 65 percent after just half an hour, and the iPhone isn’t far behind, reaching 50 percent in the same amount of time. If you frequently need a power boost, you can’t go wrong with either phone.</p><h2 id="Software-and-Features-iOS-and-Android-Have-Their-Unique-Advantages"><a href="#Software-and-Features-iOS-and-Android-Have-Their-Unique-Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Software and Features: iOS and Android Have Their Unique Advantages"></a>Software and Features: iOS and Android Have Their Unique Advantages</h2><p> iPhone 15 Pro Max</p><ul><li>Runs iOS.</li><li>Customizable Action button.</li><li>Simple and user-friendly, but little room for deep customization.</li><li>Known for its robust security measures.</li><li>Emergency SOS via satellite to reach emergency services without normal coverage.</li></ul><p> Samsung S24 Ultra</p><ul><li>Runs Android.</li><li>Built-in S Pen.</li><li>Steeper learning curve for some users, but adaptable to your preferences.</li><li>More susceptible to malware due to the availability of apps from multiple sources.</li><li>Samsung DeX for desktop mode on a TV.</li></ul><p> The software battleground between iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is a fight between familiarity and flexibility.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ios-1994355" >Apple’s iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers a polished, user-friendly experience with a focus on simplicity and tight integration between hardware and software.

Power users will appreciate the ability to tweak the interface and features to their liking. The Galaxy S24 Ultra takes advantage of this with the S Pen stylus, letting you do loads of things, like take notes, draw, write a perfect signature, translate, and interact with the phone in a precise way.</p><p> Another huge difference between iOS and Android is security.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/reasons-iphone-is-more-secure-than-android-2000308" >Apple’s closed ecosystem reduces the risk of viruses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and apps undergo strict review processes before being available on the App Store.</p><p> Android’s flexible nature means more opportunities for malicious apps to get onto the phone.

Additionally, opting for a 2-year AppleCare+ subscription will cost you less than Samsung’s equivalent Care+ plan, though neither is mandatory.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/should-you-get-applecare-ipad-4058451" >Is AppleCare+ Really Worth It? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Final-Verdict-Both-Are-Great-Depending-on-What-Matters-Most-to-You"><a href="#Final-Verdict-Both-Are-Great-Depending-on-What-Matters-Most-to-You" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict: Both Are Great, Depending on What Matters Most to You"></a>Final Verdict: Both Are Great, Depending on What Matters Most to You</h2><p> In a match between the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, it largely boils down to a fight between camera versatility and software ecosystems.</p><p> The S24 Ultra boasts a monstrous 200MP main sensor compared to the iPhone’s 48MP, but it defaults to 12MP photos. However, the iPhone pulls through with a 5x zoom lens and its praised Cinematic mode for video.</p><p> On the display front, the S24 Ultra edges out the iPhone with a slightly higher resolution and peak brightness, but the iPhone counters with superior color accuracy. And, while both phones are high-performance machines, Samsung throws in extra RAM for multitasking prowess.</p><p> Software is a major differentiator, too. iOS offers a straightforward and refined experience, while Samsung’s One UI on top of Android focuses on AI features like live translation and advanced photo editing. And both platforms work best with their respective hardware.</p><p> Ultimately, the choice depends on whether you crave the latest camera tech and AI integration (S24 Ultra) or value security, ease of use, and a long software support track record (iPhone 15 Pro Max). And, of course, your existing tech and particular budget play a role as well.  </p><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-hidden-threat-illegitimate-support-on-digital-platforms/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Hidden Threat Illegitimate Support on Digital Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-smartphone-and-tablet-companion-best-gba-simulators/"><u>[Updated] Smartphone & Tablet Companion Best GBA Simulators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-verdict-on-android-photo-editing-does-picku-excel/"><u>[Updated] The Verdict on Android Photo Editing – Does PickU Excel?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-zaraz.techidaily.com/1728490274794-sd/"><u>「データ劣化したSDメモリから情報を復元する技術ガイド」</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhanced-online-storefronts-in-3d/"><u>2024 Approved Enhanced Online Storefronts in 3D</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-perfectly-inserting-songs-on-instagram-stories/"><u>2024 Approved Step-by-Step Perfectly Inserting Songs on Instagram Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/2024s-top-choice-cops-radio-devices/"><u>2024'S Top Choice: Cops' Radio Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-look-at-the-best-nixplay-seed-frame/"><u>A Comprehensive Look at the Best Nixplay Seed Frame</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-approach-to-pinpointing-ideal-gaming-devices/"><u>A Step-by-Step Approach to Pinpointing Ideal Gaming Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/amazon-prime-day-tech-savings-extravaganza-dont-miss-the-2024-deals/"><u>Amazon Prime Day Tech Savings Extravaganza: Don't Miss the 2024 Deals!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-flight-fun-in-depth-review-of-the-holy-stone-hs170-predator-mini-drone/"><u>Budget-Friendly Flight Fun: In-Depth Review of the Holy Stone HS170 Predator Mini Drone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/cheetah-arms-secure-tv-placement-affordable-and-reliable/"><u>Cheetah Arms Secure TV Placement: Affordable & Reliable</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-of-x-plane-11s-immersive-experience-and-high-quality-graphics-in-modern-flight-training/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis of X-Plane 11'S Immersive Experience & High-Quality Graphics in Modern Flight Training</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-nook-glowlight-4-tablet-e-reader-analysis/"><u>Comprehensive Nook GlowLight 4 Tablet E-Reader Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-spotify-location-after-moving-to-another-country-on-infinix-smart-8-hd-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Infinix Smart 8 HD | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-vivo-y27-4g-phone-without-google-account-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Vivo Y27 4G Phone without Google Account?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/resolving-mapi32dll-file-not-found-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Resolving 'Mapi32.dll' File Not Found - Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-face-off-choosing-between-iphone-or-android-as-your-go-to-phone/"><u>The Ultimate Face-Off: Choosing Between iPhone or Android as Your Go-To Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/1722803147618-ultimate-guide-the-leading-exterior-discs-drives-of-236/"><u>Ultimate Guide: The Leading Exterior Discs Drives of 2#36;</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The X1 Titanium Yoga is also the thinnest ThinkPad ever at just 0.45 inches thick.</p><p> That’s an advantage, but also a challenge. ThinkPads are known for great keyboards and extensive connectivity, but packing these features in a laptop thinner than an Ethernet port isn’t easy. Can the X1 Titanium Yoga pull it off?</p><h2 id="Design-Attractive-but-flimsy"><a href="#Design-Attractive-but-flimsy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Attractive, but flimsy"></a>Design: Attractive, but flimsy</h2><p> Titanium is a durable material with a premium reputation, but it doesn’t look or feel different from aluminum. Lenovo solves this with a bumpy, tactile surface on the X1 Titanium Yoga’s display lid. It’s instantly different from smooth, slippery competitors. This 2-in-1 feels premium and luxurious the moment you pick it up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/E8GYytfe0kZjbTrwpxN0b8N5aC0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Titanium-Yoga-6-365b06caa6e14007bf0655d04828722e.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> Unfortunately, titanium doesn’t lead to outstanding rigidity. The material isn’t used throughout the entire chassis. That, along with the 2-in-1’s thin profile, allows noticeable flex when handling the laptop. It’s a disappointing trait in a laptop that sells north of $1,500.</p><p> The X1 Titanium Yoga uses a 360-degree hinge to convert into a tablet. The keyboard is always attached, so the 2-in-1 feels large and heavy when used in tablet mode. Most users will find tablet mode uncomfortable to hold for more than a few minutes at a stretch.</p><p>The X1 Titanium Yoga is the thinnest ThinkPad, ever.</p><p> Cutting thickness to 0.45 inches presents challenges for physical connectivity. With legacy ports out of the question, Lenovo goes all-in on a pair of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-usb4-5075506" >USB-C 4 ports with ThunderBolt 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

It’s closer to square than the 16:9 aspect ratio most common on laptops and, as a result, the 13.5-inch screen has far more vertical space than most laptops of comparable size.</p><p> The aspect ratio reminds me of my first laptop: a ThinkPad T42 I purchased in college. I loved that screen’s size, and while the X1 Titanium Yoga isn’t as square, it’s still an upgrade over a traditional widescreen display. The Titanium’s screen is perfect for working with long documents or multitasking with two windows side-by-side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YsLLj2-yQBwEq2GnyyHBwN5giFk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Titanium-Yoga-2-f732e0f2d9e24718a3bc28338febae40.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868590/19272" target="_top" id="1868590">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868590" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868590/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S.

That’s not as sharp as the optional 4K displays found on similarly priced alternatives like<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-xps-13-7390-2-in-1-review-5113106" >Dell’s XPS 13 2-in-1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

This close to the laptop’s entry-level configuration, though Lenovo does offer a model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. An upgraded model with a Core i7-1160G7 processor is available.</p><p> The X1 Titanium Yoga scored 4,329 in PCMark 10 with a productivity score of 6,109. This is a solid result, beating the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-stealth-13-review-4796767" >Razer Blade Stealth 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and falling just a hair behind the Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Intel’s Core i5-1130G7, a quad-core processor, won’t keep up with AMD Ryzen alternatives that offer more cores, but they’re often not available in a device this thin.</p><p> 3D performance is provided by Intel Iris Xe graphics with 80 execution units. It hit a score of 3,327 in 3DMark Fire Strike and achieved 55 frames per second in the GFXBench Car Chase test. These are modest scores, but fine for a thin Windows 2-in-1. The X1 Titanium Yoga can handle basic 3D games like Counter-Strike or Rocket League.</p><p> It felt smooth and responsive in a variety of situations and handled more demanding tasks, like photo editing, without much issue.</p><p> The optional Intel Core i7-1160G7 processor, which has 16 additional execution units, can provide a small boost.

Surprisingly, the super-think ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga avoids this problem. It has a spacious, sensible layout, and key feel is enjoyable. Key travel is just 1.35mm, which is noticeably shallow, but respectable for a thin laptop. I wrote most of this review on the laptop and enjoyed every minute of it.</p><p> The keyboard has a spacious, sensible layout, and key feel is enjoyable despite the 2-in-1’s thin profile.</p><p> The touchpad, which mimics the aspect ratio of the display, is rather small. It includes one set of physical buttons at the top, rather than the bottom, of the touchpad. It’s a sign this laptop is meant for ThinkPad purists. The location of the buttons feels odd if you use the touchpad, but it’s perfect if you prefer the Trackpoint, a red nub in the middle of the keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GXZFQjT0E2Wwq-MXSfXK1Z-M_bo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Titanium-Yoga-3-dad8616d7a0c49818a505ae7ebd963cf.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S.

The display’s 3:2 aspect ratio is great for multitasking and the keyboard is enjoyable to use for hours at a time. 2-in-1 shoppers looking for a larger display than a typical 12 or 13-inch widescreen device, without the weight and size of a 14-inch alternative, should give the X1 Titanium Yoga serious consideration.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135349/19272" target="_top" id="2135349">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135349" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135349/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review-5176484" >Lenovo Thinkpad X12 Detachable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-review-5095689" >Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Fold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-5090543" >Lenovo Chromebook Duet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga (20QA000EUS)</li><li>Product Brand  Lenovo</li><li>MPN  20QA000EUS</li><li>Price  $1,684.99</li><li>Release Date  March 2021</li><li>Weight  2.6 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  11.71 x 9.16 x 0.45 in.</li><li>Color  Titanium</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>Operating System  Windows 10 Pro</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i5-1130G7</li><li>RAM  16GB</li><li>Storage  512GB PCIe NVMe SSD</li><li>Camera  720p with IR</li><li>Audio  Dolby Atmos speaker system, 4x microphone array</li><li>Battery Capacity  44.5 watt-hour</li><li>Ports  2x USB-C 4 with Thunderbolt 4, 3.5mm combo headphone&#x2F;mic</li><li>Wi-Fi  Wi-Fi 6</li><li>Bluetooth  5.1</li><li>Waterproof  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-scaling-down-macos-from-sierra-to-el-capitan-os/"><u>[New] In 2024, Scaling Down MacOS From Sierra To El Capitan OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-essential-guide-to-snap-mastery/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Essential Guide to Snap Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-on-slomo-video-softwares-performance-for-2024/"><u>Expert Analysis on SloMo Video Software's Performance for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/find-your-perfect-cheap-mobile-plan-the-ultimate-guide-to-savings/"><u>Find Your Perfect Cheap Mobile Plan - The Ultimate Guide to Savings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/find-your-perfect-match-elite-selection-of-17-inch-laptops/"><u>Find Your Perfect Match: Elite Selection of 17-Inch Laptops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-solve-iphone-guided-access-malfunction-issues-quickly/"><u>How To Solve iPhone Guided Access Malfunction Issues Quickly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/how-to-update-and-install-graphics-card-drivers-for-the-dell-g15-laptop-in-windows-environment/"><u>How to Update & Install Graphics Card Drivers for the Dell G15 Laptop in Windows Environment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-upgrading-to-big-sur-know-your-hardware-standards/"><u>In 2024, Upgrading to Big Sur?

As someone with joint issues, I’ve found the console molds perfectly in my hands, even over many hours.</p><p> It has a smaller screen than the standard Nintendo Switch, but games continue to run in 720p, so it still looks pretty good. There’s no performance drop here—just a more petite build.</p><p> I played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and it was still excellent fun and immersive. Exploring the console is straightforward and clearly laid out, so newcomers and children can quickly figure out what to do.</p><p> Games can be bought digitally or as physical cartridges. The console has 32GB of internal storage, which can always be upgraded with a microSD card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TmYyOgzBYexzwHM_D35w2XJF68c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NintendoSwitchLite1-33b6996f36534d1da9974a460e6c5139.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite gaming console."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098700/14409" target="_top" id="2098700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098700/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p> That’s not to say that concessions aren’t made here.

During my time with them, I spent dozens of hours comparing them.</p><p> That included seeing how quickly each console loaded and allowed me to immediately play a game and how simple it was to do so.</p><p> I also looked at the number of games available for each system, any advantages they offer, and whether the controller felt comfortable and intuitive to use.</p><p> I also considered possibly the most critical factor – how much fun it was to play on each console, which made me want to return for more.</p><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p> What to Look For</p><p> Buying a games console is never a cheap proposition, so buying the right one for you and your needs is essential, rather than making a mistake.</p><p> To help you figure out which game console is best for you, consider these key things before you buy:</p><p><strong>Who’s playing?</strong></p><p> All game consoles have a variety of games aimed at different age groups, but some are better for certain players than others.</p><p> For instance, PlayStation has many hard-hitting single-player experiences with stories exploring adult themes. It may also have games like Bluey and the Lego titles, but its strength is in more adult titles.</p><p> Alternatively, the Nintendo Switch has the Mario franchise, which is very family-friendly. Many couch co-op and multiplayer titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, offer a more sociable experience.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p> Do you already own a console? That can affect what your next one should be.</p><p> Almost all Xbox One accessories work with the Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, so if you already have some controllers or a headset, it makes sense to stick with the same ecosystem.</p><p> Also, if you have digital or physical copies of games, it’s worth checking if you can still play those on the new console.</p><p> The PS5 plays PS4 games, and the Xbox Series X&#x2F;S plays Xbox One games; however, the Switch isn’t backward compatible with the Nintendo Wii U.</p><p><strong>Convenience</strong></p><p> Some consoles are more portable than others. Something like the Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 will live under your TV or next to your monitor and can’t easily be transported elsewhere.</p><p> The Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck work portably and are docked to a screen. It’s worth considering how important portability is for you. Generally, consoles that solely work via a TV or monitor tend to be more powerful, but you miss out on quickly taking it out with you.</p><p> The newest gaming consoles can be pricey, but you don’t have to spend much for an exciting gaming experience. For instance, Nintendo’s consoles, on average, cost about $100 less than many of its competitors. You can also find great deals on classic systems.</p><p> If you’ve previously owned a gaming console, you should consider buying a new one compatible with the library of games you’ve likely collected.</p><p> For example, newer PlayStations won’t play games from older Sony consoles, but you can still access hundreds of older PlayStation titles using the PS Now streaming service.</p><p> On the other hand, Xbox consoles have much better backward compatibility, not to mention a digital redemption scheme that lets you download newer versions of your existing games for free.</p><p> How important is it to you to be able to play your favorite games in true 4K? If your answer is “very,” you’ll want a console that supports 2160p or higher, but if your answer is “not really,” you can settle for something else. The same goes for virtual reality, as not all systems will support it.  </p><p> For more advice,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/before-you-buy-gaming-console-8654423" >read our gaming console buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Other-Consoles-We-Considered"><a href="#Other-Consoles-We-Considered" class="headerlink" title="Other Consoles We Considered"></a>Other Consoles We Considered</h2><ul><li>The<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-Mario-Red/dp/B09NCMZNJK?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4154610%7Cnbb55c893b84e43b6a51559b2a372e81214%7C" >Nintendo Switch OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the ultimate Nintendo Switch.

Unfortunately, there is no way to install granular upgrades like you would see with a gaming PC, but you still have the option to increase your storage space or swap its color for something more palatable.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-affordable-pc-monitoring-software-for-2024/"><u>[New] Affordable PC Monitoring Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-sharper-stars-in-iphone-nocturne-photos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Sharper Stars in iPhone Nocturne Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-compelling-podcast-teasers/"><u>[Updated] Crafting Compelling Podcast Teasers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-compilation-techniques-for-posting-youtube-videos-on-facebook/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Compilation Techniques for Posting YouTube Videos on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-maximizing-harvest-valheims-prime-planting-choices/"><u>2024 Approved Maximizing Harvest Valheim's Prime Planting Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/aukey-30-usb-hub-assessment-unadorned-elegance-meets-practicality/"><u>Aukey 3.0 USB Hub Assessment: Unadorned Elegance Meets Practicality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/canon-mp280mg2800-all-in-one-driver-software-for-windows-7-8-and-latest-versions/"><u>Canon MP280/MG2800 All-in-One Driver Software for Windows 7, 8 & Latest Versions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-zmi-powerpack-20000-analysis-unrivaled-portability-and-performance/"><u>Comprehensive ZMI PowerPack 20000 Analysis: Unrivaled Portability and Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/dive-into-the-compelling-digital-world-of-nhls-latest-sports-offering/"><u>Dive Into the Compelling Digital World of NHL's Latest Sports Offering</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/examining-the-oneplus-8t-rapid-functionality-overshadowed-by-erratic-imaging-capabilities/"><u>Examining the OnePlus 8T: Rapid Functionality Overshadowed by Erratic Imaging Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/exploring-english-accents-from-british-to-aussie/"><u>Exploring English Accents: From British To Aussie</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/get-the-latest-windows-drivers-for-your-brother-hl-l2380dw-laser-printer-now/"><u>Get the Latest Windows Drivers for Your Brother HL-L2380DW Laser Printer Now!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/guide-converting-your-dvds-into-digital-format-for-seamless-nas-streaming-and-backup/"><u>Guide: Converting Your DVDs Into Digital Format for Seamless NAS Streaming and Backup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-2024-black-hero-4-or-ghost-s-choosing-the-best-motorsport-camera/"><u>In 2024, Black Hero 4 or Ghost-S Choosing the Best Motorsport Camera</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/maximizing-gaming-4-solid-reasons-to-get-ps5/"><u>Maximizing Gaming: 4 Solid Reasons to Get PS5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/pinnacle-audio-tech-prime-choices-for-your-screen-experience/"><u>Pinnacle Audio Tech: Prime Choices for Your Screen Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-havit-5-fan-cooling-pad-stay-chill-while-you-game/"><u>Ultimate Guide to the HAVIT 5-Fan Cooling Pad - Stay Chill While You Game!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/unboxing-and-testing-the-spectacularly-adaptable-dell-xps-13-7390-a-hybrid-laptop-masterpiece-reviewed/"><u>Unboxing and Testing the Spectacularly Adaptable Dell XPS 13 7390: A Hybrid Laptop Masterpiece Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/unmatched-audio-experience-with-high-fidelity-muffs/"><u>Unmatched Audio Experience with High-Fidelity Muffs</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The antenna has a thin, flat, disc shape that is black on one side and white on the other. It is designed to be placed directly onto a flat surface, but you will probably be able to get away with a lot of different orientations depending on how close you are to the signal source.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Simple-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Simple-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Simple and easy"></a><strong>Setup: Simple and easy</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream Eclipse Antenna has the simplest setup of all the HDTV antennas I’ve tested. There is no mounting hardware, no power adapter, and nothing else to worry about. The antenna comes with a strip of adhesive that can be used to affix it directly to a wall or other preferred surface.</p><p> The ClearStream Eclipse Antenna had the best results of any unpowered antenna, even beating out a few of the powered ones.</p><p> Luckily the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna comes with a 12ft coaxial cable, so next simply attach the cable to both the antenna and your TV. Make sure to run a channel scan first for best results.</p><h2 id="Performance-Above-average"><a href="#Performance-Above-average" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Above average"></a><strong>Performance: Above average</strong></h2><p> I’ve tested a lot of similar antennas recently, and the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna had the best results of any unpowered antenna, even beating out a few of the powered ones. From my apartment, I was able to get acquire an average of 65 channels across all my tests. For reference, the worst-performing antenna found just 47, and the best, 76.</p><h2 id="Range-Fair-to-middling"><a href="#Range-Fair-to-middling" class="headerlink" title="Range: Fair to middling"></a><strong>Range: Fair to middling</strong></h2><p> Antenna’s Direct rates the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna for up to 35 miles of range, although I’ve seen reports of people getting good results from further, or having trouble from much closer. My apartment is well within the supported range, so my sentiments reflect its use in city settings more than suburbs or exurbs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/i57THpEHitQ6h-N5c-bgGLEHwJs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_Eclipse_04-6ea1dbbe93374539876c7e76dcebb18e.jpg"                      alt="ClearStream Eclipse Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-Not-bad-for-the-performance"><a href="#Price-Not-bad-for-the-performance" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not bad for the performance"></a><strong>Price: Not bad for the performance</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream Eclipse Antenna lands at an MSRP of $40, putting it towards the high end of the price spectrum, especially where non-powered antennas are concerned. It did do one of the best jobs of supporting as many channels as possible, so the price is somewhat justified. Then again, every single one of the indoor antennas I’ve tested was able to handle the major network channels clearly and without issue, so a high channel number might not mean more than peace of mind in practical terms.</p><h2 id="ClearStream-Eclipse-Antenna-vs-Winegard-FL5500A-FlatWave-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-Eclipse-Antenna-vs-Winegard-FL5500A-FlatWave-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream Eclipse Antenna vs Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream Eclipse Antenna vs Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna</strong></h2><p> If my testing is any indication of broader performance, there is really no reason to get the Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna instead of the ClearStream Eclipse. The Eclipse is over $10 cheaper ($40 vs $52), and managed to support 8 more channels on average. To add insult to injury, the Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna is amplified using a USB power adapter, which adds a bit of clutter and complication to the overall setup.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The best unpowered indoor antenna.</strong></p><p> The ClearStream Eclipse is one of the best options for buyers looking for a new indoor antenna. It performed better than a lot of the competition, despite being far simpler.

It works on most cars made in the U.S. after 1996 or in the EU or Asia after 2000 and supports multiple languages, including English, French, Spanish, Russian, and German. The large LCD has a white backlight to make it easy to read even in dim lighting.</p><p> If it turns out that your code isn’t serious, this device can turn off that annoying check engine light. The scanner comes with a 2.5-foot long, well-insulated cable that connects with your car’s OBDII data link connector; no other battery or charger is required as it powers up through that link. A three-year warranty means you can rest easy choosing this scanner.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> No |<strong>Built-in Display:</strong> Yes |<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.02”x6.34”x1.38” |<strong>Weight:</strong> 9.6 Oz</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1498635">                    <video width="320" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1498635">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:200px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fancheer.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1498635%2F17326'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1498635/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Splurge"><a href="#Splurge" class="headerlink" title="Splurge"></a>Splurge</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" >BlueDriver Professional OBDII Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" >$100 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/415766460" >$120 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Works through a user-friendly app</li><li>Durable</li><li>Always stays plugged in</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Bluetooth connection can be a bit spotty</li><li>Pricey</li></ul><p> The BlueDriver OBDII Scanner isn’t the cheapest option out there, but seeing as it’s aimed at those who want more professional readings than you can get from all-in-one units, that’s to be expected. This tiny sensor, once installed, transmits codes, errors, and information via Bluetooth to the BlueDriver app. This app is the centerpiece of the whole unit, as it’s one of the most beautifully designed and full-featured pieces of software we’ve seen. You can call up codes, search them, and even set the app into HUD mode to treat it as an onboard meter.</p><p> What’s extra interesting about this is the 24&#x2F;7 support, meaning you can contact an actual human if you need more information on a particular reading. You can even have the app generate on-demand repair reports compiled and verified by certified technicians. These repair reports are pulled from a database of over 6.6 million vehicle-specific diagnostics, so chances are, you can pull one up for your specific vehicle.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Yes |<strong>Built-in Display:</strong> No |<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 2.2”x1.9”x1” |<strong>Weight:</strong> 2.08 Oz</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938750/19272" target="_top" id="1938750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938750/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Car Code Reader"></a>What to Look For in a Car Code Reader</h2><h3 id="Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Ease of Use"></a>Ease of Use</h3><p> If you haven’t had a car code reader before, purchase a simple one.

OBD2 is a universal interface in most cars introduced in the 1980s. While it won’t work on every old car out there, you should be covered as long as it is somewhat new. Almost all newer cars will support it.</li><li>Are car code readers worth it?<br> Car code readers are relatively inexpensive, making them a worthwhile investment if you want to pinpoint an issue with your vehicle without taking it to an expensive mechanic. A car code reader lets you read and clear codes, view basic parameter IDs, and check and reset readiness monitors. This gives you an excellent way to tell if the problem is something you can fix quickly before shelling out to a car shop, potentially saving you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars.</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-expert-tips-on-choosing-top-9-webcam-enhancement-tools/"><u>[Updated] Expert Tips on Choosing Top 9 Webcam Enhancement Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-get-a-faster-live-streaming-on-periscope/"><u>2024 Approved How to Get a Faster Live Streaming on Periscope</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/dont-fall-victim-identifying-the-five-most-prevalent-chatgpt-schemes/"><u>Don't Fall Victim: Identifying the Five Most Prevalent ChatGPT Schemes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/exceptional-deals-on-the-oneplus-6t-top-notch-efficiency-explored/"><u>Exceptional Deals on the OnePlus 6T: Top-Notch Efficiency Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/experience-the-ultimate-jrpg-with-yakuza-like-a-dragon/"><u>Experience the Ultimate JRPG with Yakuza: Like a Dragon!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-of-dji-mavic-2-pro-unrivaled-dominance-in-the-professional-drone-sphere/"><u>Expert Analysis of DJI Mavic 2 Pro: Unrivaled Dominance in the Professional Drone Sphere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/exploring-similarities-and-disparities-amazon-kindle-and-fire-tablet-compared/"><u>Exploring Similarities and Disparities: Amazon Kindle and Fire Tablet Compared</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/exploring-the-benefits-how-size-matters-with-the-apple-iphone-phone-12-pro-max/"><u>Exploring the Benefits: How Size Matters with the Apple iPhone ^[Phone] 12 Pro Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/exploring-the-netgear-nighthawk-rax80-a-comprehensive-wi-fi-6-experience/"><u>Exploring the Netgear Nighthawk RAX80: A Comprehensive Wi-Fi 6 Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/getting-acquainted-with-the-latest-innovations-in-the-apple-iphone-15-pro/"><u>Getting Acquainted with the Latest Innovations in the Apple iPhone 15 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-from-network-not-found-error-windows/"><u>How to Recover From 'Network Not Found' Error Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-card-on-itel-p55-online-without-jailbreak-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock SIM Card on Itel P55 online without jailbreak</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/navigate-through-tech-innovations-with-toms-hardware-reviews/"><u>Navigate Through Tech Innovations with Tom's Hardware Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/next-level-gaming-premium-vr-players-reviewed-for-2024/"><u>Next-Level Gaming Premium VR Players Reviewed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-atari-the400-mini-reimagined-rediscovering-vintage-computer-game-delights-in-a-contemporary-package/"><u>The Atari THE400 Mini Reimagined - Rediscovering Vintage Computer Game Delights in a Contemporary Package</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-polaroid-camplus-experience-for-action-lovers/"><u>The Ultimate Polaroid Cam+ Experience for Action Lovers</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Fitness trackers have come a long way over the last few years, and you can find options in a variety of shapes, sizes, styles, and price ranges. The Garmin Vivosmart 4 is priced in about the mid-range, and it offers a few cool perks in addition to the standards like calorie counting and step counting. I tested the Garmin Vivosmart 4 for a month to see how it performs compared to other similarly priced fitness trackers on the market.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1186864/12108" target="_top" id="1186864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1186864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1186864/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-You-can’t-remove-the-band"><a href="#Design-You-can’t-remove-the-band" class="headerlink" title="Design: You can’t remove the band"></a><strong>Design: You can’t remove the band</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart is lightweight, weighing only 16.5 grams (for the small&#x2F;medium size). It has a very slim profile, with the silicone band measuring only about a half of an inch in width. Now, this is great for style purposes, as the band looks great on the wrist. But, the slim design isn’t particularly functional, as the screen is extremely small and somewhat hard to read from a distance (especially if you have poor vision like me). The tiny screen measures a mere 0.26 inches wide by 0.70 inches tall.</p><p> The Vivosmart 4 has a unibody design, and you cannot remove the tracker portion from the band. I was somewhat disappointed to see that I couldn’t switch out the bands for other colors and styles, especially considering Garmin has such attractive band options. Unfortunately, you can only choose one—grey with rose gold trim, berry with light gold trim, azure blue with silver trim, or the band I tested, black with midnight trim. The band also comes in small&#x2F;medium or large sizes. The small&#x2F;medium size fit my wrist well, but when I had my husband try on the band, it wouldn’t fit around his wrist. Other trackers, like the Fitbit Charge 4, come with both a small and large band.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JsDCEVwOi6EK7WLcs2WJ03jOZb0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivosmart-4-Fitness-Tracker-3-ba9d18a527ae4b41a7242ffaccd1de30.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139120/17108" target="_top" id="2139120">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139120" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139120/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-You’ll-forget-you’re-wearing-it"><a href="#Comfort-You’ll-forget-you’re-wearing-it" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: You’ll forget you’re wearing it"></a><strong>Comfort: You’ll forget you’re wearing it</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart 4 is one of the more comfortable fitness trackers I’ve tested. Most of the time, I’d forget I was even wearing the tracker until it vibrated. The band’s side edges are rounded off, making it feel more comfortable against the skin.</p><p> The buckle doesn’t press into the skin or cause irritation, but the sides of the silicone band do leave indents on the wrist after long periods of wear. The Vivosmart 4 is waterproof, and you can wear it in the pool, wear it while showering, and in the rain without damaging the device. You really only have to take off the Vivosmart to charge the battery.</p><h2 id="Performance-Body-battery-and-stress-monitoring"><a href="#Performance-Body-battery-and-stress-monitoring" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Body battery and stress monitoring"></a><strong>Performance: Body battery and stress monitoring</strong></h2><p> The Garmin Vivosmart 4 performs exceptionally well in some areas and mediocre in others, making it a decent device for runners or everyday users who want a device to track their general health and wellness, but a not such great device for fitness buffs who want seamless and accurate workout tracking.</p><p> The Vivosmart 4 has some cool perks, like a pulse ox sensor that can track blood oxygen saturation levels, and a body battery feature that uses a variety of data (oxygen, sleep, heart rate, etc) to determine how much energy you have available. The body battery feature is perhaps the most useful tool within this tracker, as it lets you know when you need to take it easy and when you have more energy available to spend. There’s also a stress monitoring widget you can place right on the tracker’s interface, which I also found incredibly useful. I was in the process of moving while testing the Vivosmart 4, and I could watch my stress levels rising as I went through the stresses of packing, moving, and buying and selling my homes.</p><p> The body battery feature is perhaps the most useful tool within this tracker, as it lets you know when you need to take it easy and when you have more energy available to spend.</p><p> On the downside, the Vivosmart 4’s step counter isn’t exactly accurate, although this tends to be a common problem with fitness trackers. I also saw some issues with the accuracy of the heart rate monitor, as I tested the heart rate monitor against a chest monitor, and it was off by as much as 10 beats per minute.</p><p> Workout tracking is somewhat lacking in the Vivosmart 4. It has a feature called Move IQ, which is supposed to identify periods of movement that match familiar exercise patterns like walking, running, biking, swimming, or using an elliptical machine. It then automatically starts timing the event for you. This feature is only accurate some of the time though. It detects walking pretty consistently, but it doesn’t do as good of a job at detecting swimming or biking. For strength training, it has a rep counter, but you can also turn on auto-set, and the Vivosmart 4 will attempt to automatically determine when you’re performing a repetitive motion and estimate the number of reps. These features aren’t always accurate though, and you may have to go in and edit the data afterward.</p><p> I tested the heart rate monitor against a chest monitor and it was off by as much as 10 beats per minute.</p><p> Overall, the Garmin Vivosmart 4 is capable of providing an abundance of useful data, but it requires a bit more effort on the part of the user to obtain this information. If you do things like add a custom stride length, edit any activities that didn’t track accurately, track hydration and weight goals, use the female health features, and pair the Garmin Connect app with the My Fitness Pal app, you can get a comprehensive health and fitness tracking experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Fu0WY5D4aslVxU_cls1YqWYQBeg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivosmart-4-Fitness-Tracker-2-67ea15321c9541f1b57d5528302152fe.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Software-Garmin-Connect-App"><a href="#Software-Garmin-Connect-App" class="headerlink" title="Software: Garmin Connect App"></a><strong>Software: Garmin Connect App</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart 4 doesn’t have any hard buttons, but rather a monotone touchscreen that you double-tap on the bottom portion to awaken. You scroll up and down to navigate through the various functions. I’m not in love with the interface, which isn’t particularly intuitive or feature-rich. Although companion apps are important to any good fitness tracker, the Vivosmart 4 relies too heavily on its app. It doesn’t have built-in GPS either, so it’s more tethered to your phone than some other fitness trackers on the market.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-connect-course-creator-tool-1683347" >Garmin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Connect app is pretty comprehensive though. You can customize your widgets and choose up to six displayed activities. You can also enable smart notifications, which will send call and text alerts to your Vivosmart 4 or send all notifications. I made the mistake of selecting “all notifications,” and I received, well, all notifications (from my video doorbell, security camera, and shopping apps). I quickly changed the setting to receive notifications for calls and texts only.</p><p> The Garmin Connect app allows you to dive as deep into your fitness tracking as you want. If you’re a runner, it can track everything from your cadence to your max pace. It provides charts and graphs of your long term activity level, heart rate, stress, body battery, and more. You can also use insights to compare that data with the averages in your age and gender category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XmHmMYvuaOGE3gAGIsa_vChmpas=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivosmart-4-Fitness-Tracker-4-22ab906932be467bb2e3309e30555ab4.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959712/19272" target="_top" id="1959712">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959712" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959712/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130874/7443" target="_top" id="2130874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-May-last-a-full-seven-days"><a href="#Battery-May-last-a-full-seven-days" class="headerlink" title="Battery: May last a full seven days"></a><strong>Battery: May last a full seven days</strong></h2><p> The battery is supposed to last for up to seven days, but the battery life depends largely on the features you use and how frequently you use the tracker. If you’re only passively tracking a few metrics, your battery might last a full week. If you’re constantly checking your heart rate, pulse ox, stress levels, sleep, and counting reps several times a day, your battery will not last that long. I got three and a half days of battery life when taking full advantage of the fitness tracker’s features.</p><p> The battery charges using a clip-on charger. It took an average of 90 minutes to reach a full charge (from about 10% full).</p><h2 id="Price-Reasonable"><a href="#Price-Reasonable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart 4 retails for $130, which is slightly high for this unit. You can find a refurbished version on Amazon for around $80, which is a more reasonable price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100541/7443" target="_top" id="2100541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Garmin-Vivosmart-4-vs-Fitbit-Charge-3"><a href="#Garmin-Vivosmart-4-vs-Fitbit-Charge-3" class="headerlink" title="Garmin Vivosmart 4 vs. Fitbit Charge 3"></a><strong>Garmin Vivosmart 4 vs. Fitbit Charge 3</strong></h2><p> I found the Garmin Vivosmart 4 much more comfortable than the Fitbit Charge 3. I also like the body battery and stress monitoring features in the Vivosmart 4. On the other hand, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-charge-3-review-5072527" >Fitbit Charge 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has a more accurate heart monitor (according to testing). The Fitbit Charge 3 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FTN21JL/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5072535%7Cn5f18362fc97d487e830fd6d6cfaf2af211%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) also offers a ton of workouts in its Fitbit app, and slightly more seamless activity tracking for weight training and high-intensity workouts. If you want a day-to-day fitness tracker to track your sleep, stress, and energy levels, the Vivosmart 4 is a great option.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Upgraded Sumind Bluetooth FM Transmitter is a larger Bluetooth device that works through your car’s existing stereo system. You can connect nearly any Bluetooth-enabled device and enjoy your music or hands-free calling. We investigated Sumind’s interesting design, usability, audio quality, and the special features that make it stand out from the competition.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Benjamin Zeman</p><h2 id="Design-User-friendly-design"><a href="#Design-User-friendly-design" class="headerlink" title="Design: User friendly design"></a><strong>Design: User friendly design</strong></h2><p> The Sumind Bluetooth Car FM Transmitter has two main parts connected with a flexible gooseneck. The part that plugs into a car’s 12V power outlet has both an intelligent 5V&#x2F;2.4<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> charging port and a QC3.0 charging port. At the tip of the side that plugs into your car is an extended removable piece with a replaceable fuse. It’s not clear whether that additional piece was at fault, but we found the device more difficult to plug in than others we tested.</p><p> On the opposite side of the gooseneck is the device’s main body. On the front is a large 1.7 inch<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-liquid-crystal-display-lcd-2625913" >LCD screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that displays information bright and clear but only at limited viewing angles. Sumind advertises that the gooseneck can be rotated 270 degrees but we found that when we tried to angle the display towards us in the driver’s seat, the gooseneck wouldn’t stay in position. Instead it would snapback, leading us to believe that unless the gooseneck needs to be “broken in” with a little more movement there’s closer to 180 degrees of rotation.</p><p> The fact that the primary input function of the aux port is so crippled is a significant downside, and if you’re mainly looking to connect a device via aux a likely dealbreaker.</p><p> There’s a large multifunction button and volume knob under the display with a ring around it that lights up when the device is powered on. On the left side are + and - buttons to adjust the radio frequency channel and on the right are next&#x2F;last buttons to navigate songs. The buttons are fairly large and easy to use.</p><p> On the left side of the body is a TF slot so you can play audio files from a MicroSD card. On the right is a 3.5mm auxiliary jack that is advertised as_both_ an input and an output (more on that later). Since the body is on a flexible gooseneck, it’s easy to get to both the TF slot and the aux jack. With the large buttons and display, the Sumind transmitter is designed to be very user friendly.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-but-hard-to-angle"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-but-hard-to-angle" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy but hard to angle"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy but hard to angle</strong></h2><p> We tested this transmitter in a 2018 Toyota RAV4, which has two 12V auxiliary power outlets under the dash. Getting the Sumind transmitter into a position we could see from the driver’s seat was impossible. Although the screen is bright and easy to read from straight on, the viewing angles are poor and even with the amount of rotation the gooseneck allowed we couldn’t get it pointed straight at us.</p><p> The transmitter plugged right into our car’s 12V power outlet and we easily paired it to our phone over Bluetooth. We matched an empty FM radio frequency on our radio to an FM frequency on the device and audio worked right away. Listening to music and taking phone calls was easy and intuitive.</p><p> Using the TF card slot is as simple as putting in a card that has audio files in a supported format. The next&#x2F;last buttons on the right are used to navigate through your songs. Switching between Bluetooth and charging mode is done by holding the next song button for five seconds. Overall setup was a breeze.</p><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Loud-and-clear"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Loud-and-clear" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Loud and clear"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Loud and clear</strong></h2><p> We were impressed with the Sumind Bluetooth Car FM Transmitter’s clear, low-noise audio. The BT70B has good noise- and interference-reduction technology and it’s evident in the high-quality audio. Audio is streamed over bluetooth version 4.2 and the TF slot supports FAT formatted MicroSD cards up to 32GB with MP3 or WMA audio files.</p><p> The BT70B has good noise- and interference-reduction technology and it’s evident in the high-quality audio.</p><p> Call quality was just as good as music and podcasts. The built-in microphone works well and hearing our buddy on the other end of a call wasn’t a problem. Overall we found the audio quality to be really solid, with the exception of one of Sumind’s special features—an aux jack that supports both input and output. Let’s take a closer look at this oddity.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Benjamin Zeman</p><h2 id="Features-The-weirdest-feature-we’ve-seen"><a href="#Features-The-weirdest-feature-we’ve-seen" class="headerlink" title="Features: The weirdest feature we’ve seen"></a><strong>Features: The weirdest feature we’ve seen</strong></h2><p> The only truly unique difference between the Sumind Bluetooth Car FM Transmitter and many others like it is its unusual input&#x2F;output combo jack. Honestly, the only reason we can think of for a 3.5mm aux jack that works both as an input and an output is that Sumind used jacks that just happened to have a chipset that also supports output.</p><p> It’s a novel feature, but the problem is that the aux input is plagued with issues. We thought at first the jack might be broken, but the aux output worked flawlessly. The included aux cable that came with the transmitter was really low quality and super noisy when we tested it with another transmitter, but when we used a known working aux cable it still didn’t work. Then we plugged the cable from the aux output of the transmitter into the aux input of our car. It was lower volume than any other audio but it worked.</p><p> Of course, the use cases for a 3.5mm output are extremely limited. The fact that the primary input function of the aux port is so crippled is a significant downside, and if you’re mainly looking to connect a device via aux a likely dealbreaker.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137211/26400" target="_top" id="2137211">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137211" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137211/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-High-quality-as-expected"><a href="#Software-High-quality-as-expected" class="headerlink" title="Software: High quality, as expected"></a><strong>Software: High quality, as expected</strong></h2><p> Sumind’s large display allows a large amount of information to be displayed, and the software handles it well. It does an excellent job of surfacing the most important information. There’s an icon showing whether or not Bluetooth is on, if a track is paused or playing, the volume level, the FM frequency, and what device the transmitter is connected to. Every software function worked great and we didn’t notice any lag or glitches.</p><p> The BT70B is an excellent current gen transmitter and an easy, inexpensive way to add Bluetooth functionality to your vehicle.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948937/19272" target="_top" id="1948937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Slightly-higher-than-average"><a href="#Price-Slightly-higher-than-average" class="headerlink" title="Price: Slightly higher than average"></a><strong>Price: Slightly higher than average</strong></h2><p> The Sumind BT70B transmitter averages around $26 and can sometimes be found for less with a little bargain hunting. It’s on the higher end of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-fm-transmitters-for-car-1999388" >Bluetooth transmitters we’ve tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> but it packs all the features we want, except for a working auxiliary input. We often use a portable music player and an aux input is a must.</p><p> Sumind’s offering is otherwise a solid value. It’s got everything else you need and good audio quality to boot. Couple that with the large, user-friendly buttons and you have a winner.</p><h2 id="Competition-Sumind-BT70B-vs-Nulaxy-KM18"><a href="#Competition-Sumind-BT70B-vs-Nulaxy-KM18" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Sumind BT70B vs. Nulaxy KM18"></a><strong>Competition: Sumind BT70B vs. Nulaxy KM18</strong></h2><p> The Nulaxy KM18 is an older gen model with all the same functionality as the Sumind BT70B and can usually found between $17 and $20. If you’re looking to save a few dollars the Nulaxy could be a good bet.</p><p> It also has good audio quality with low noise, easy to use buttons, and an aux jack that works. However, the display is smaller and more difficult to see and like Sumind’s transmitter the gooseneck cable isn’t very flexible.</p><p> The KM18 is an older gen model from 2015 and has been a very popular option for years. Nulaxy also makes an upgraded KM18 Plus version. We think all three are good options that justify their price tag. If we didn’t need a working aux input we’d probably choose the Sumind, especially because we prefer the shape of the chassis and the convenience of two USB charging ports.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nulaxy-km18-bluetooth-car-fm-transmitter-review-4771222" >Nulaxy KM18 Bluetooth Car FM Transmitter Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The Sumind BT70B</strong>   <strong>Bluetooth FM Transmitter is a good buy with some quality control issues.</strong></p><p> We like Sumind’s shape and the large, easy-to-use buttons and dial. It has the largest and best looking display we saw in this round of testing and audio sounded great from any source.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> A standing desk isn’t complete without a standing desk mat, at least not if you value your comfort. We tried out the Topo by Ergodriven Standing Desk Mat, testing it for comfort, design, and performance. We decided to test it for a few hours a day over the course of a week to see how it worked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KYfJPJ0jHZhmy15IUeGxDL8kmRw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Ergodriven-Topo-Comfort-Mat-2-547d9823c4ac47cbb5a360040866172a.jpg"                      alt="Ergodriven Topo Standing Desk Mat"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Design-Simply-modern"><a href="#Design-Simply-modern" class="headerlink" title="Design: Simply modern"></a><strong>Design: Simply modern</strong></h2><p> At 26.2 inches by 29 inches (LW), the Topo is a fairly wide mat, giving the user lots of berth to shift around. It comes with two power wedges in the back with calf-stretching inclines in the front that end up going 2.7 inches high, though the bottom platform of the mat is much thinner. It also comes with a massage mound in the center of the mat. For the most part, we liked the mat, but placing the massage mound in the center we felt was detrimental for standing space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0MLp0JKyXodrqDxUdun30XlUicQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Ergodriven-Topo-Comfort-Mat-3-5e85cbed72974e018684fe954f0ddf1b-75abe4f41eba41c3b202cdf74fbf3caa.jpg"                      alt="Ergodriven Topo Standing Desk Mat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977023">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977023">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977023%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977023/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/977686/11832" target="_top" id="977686">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-977686" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/977686/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Flawed-but-still-solid"><a href="#Performance-Flawed-but-still-solid" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Flawed, but still solid"></a><strong>Performance: Flawed, but still solid</strong></h2><p> As we previously stated, one of the features of this mat is the massage mound in the center. When we first stepped onto the mat, we really disliked how we couldn’t shift without bumping the massage mound. It’s a great feature if you want to change your ankle stances or relieve your foot pain. However, if you’re standing on the mat for extended hours at a time, your feet are stuck off to the sides and you really can’t shift around as time progresses.</p><p> For the most part, we liked the mat, but placing the massage mound in the center, we felt was detrimental for standing space.</p><p> That said, other features of the mat are spectacular. The front wedges are designed to stretch your calves. When we used them throughout the day, they really helped to relieve the tightness from extended standing periods. Though we did feel they were a steeper incline than other mats we’ve recently tested.</p><p> Another great feature is the rear power wedges. While technically it’s one large wedge, there’s a small groove you can rest your heel to change up your stretches as the day passes by. It’s steeper than other models we tested. The steeper incline was better in many ways because it gave us a more intense hamstring stretch. It was a great way to get the blood circulating.</p><p> While technically it’s one large wedge, there’s a small groove in which you can rest your heel to change up your stretches as the day passes by.</p><p> We also liked how the mat slides around on various surfaces, but it’s not too slippery. We hauled it around to various offices with tile and carpet. Each time we set it down, we could push it under the desk with ease if we needed to sit for extended lengths of time and pull it out just as easily when we wanted to stand.</p><h2 id="Price-Pretty-steep-for-a-mat"><a href="#Price-Pretty-steep-for-a-mat" class="headerlink" title="Price: Pretty steep for a mat"></a><strong>Price: Pretty steep for a mat</strong></h2><p> At around $100 on Amazon, the Topo is in the higher price range for a standing desk mat. We could find models that don’t have the massage mound in the center, however, the steep power wedges in the back make it a reasonable investment for anyone who really wants to stretch out their legs.</p><p> For a standing desk mat with some exercise features, the Ergodriven Topo is a fairly decent choice.</p><h2 id="Topo-Ergodriven-vs-CubeFit-TerraMat"><a href="#Topo-Ergodriven-vs-CubeFit-TerraMat" class="headerlink" title="Topo Ergodriven vs. CubeFit TerraMat"></a><strong>Topo Ergodriven vs. CubeFit TerraMat</strong></h2><p> We decided to compare the Ergodriven Topo against CubeFit’s TerraMat. Price-wise, they’re very similar, retailing around $100. They also come with massage mounds and various power wedges. However, the TerraMat has more features on the mat itself, including a balance bar and plantar mounds off to the sides, as well as a massage mound in the front. None of the actual features are located in the TerraMat’s center, unlike the Topo mat.</p><p> While the TerraMat may have more features for you, it also shows more dirt, which we found was a large turnoff, especially since you’re encouraged to use these mats sans shoes. We really didn’t like putting our feet onto a clearly dirty mat. The Ergodriven mat hides dirt and slides more easily across the floor than the TerraMat. If you prefer a mat that hides the dirt, but still comes with the main stretching features, we recommend the Ergodriven. However, if you want all the bells and whistles to a standing desk mat, we think the TerraMat would be the better choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/cubefit-terramat-review-4775307" >CubeFit TerraMat Standing Desk Mat Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Pricey, but solid for the features.</strong></p><p> For a standing desk mat with some exercise features, the Ergodriven Topo is a fairly decent choice. While we think there are other, better mats out there, but the Topo does hide dirt better, and the deep rear wedges stretch the hamstrings more than most other models on the market. If you want a solid stretch, then the Ergodriven Topo is the best choice for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925544/19272" target="_top" id="1925544">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925544" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925544/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Topo Standing Desk Mat</li><li>Product Brand  Ergodriven</li><li>MPN  000101FBA_9103</li><li>Price  $99.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  26.2 x 29 x 2.7 in.</li><li>Warranty  Seven Years</li><li>Connectivity Options  None</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-strategies-for-lengthening-gopros-electric-life/"><u>[New] Strategies for Lengthening GoPro's Electric Life</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-exploring-best-stream-software-is-xsplit-outshining-obs-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] Exploring Best Stream Software - Is XSplit Outshining OBS, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-is-paying-monthly-just-for-ad-free-streaming-or-are-there-more-benefits-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Is Paying Monthly Just For Ad-Free Streaming, Or Are There More Benefits for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-the-path-to-youtube-gaming-popularity-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Path to YouTube Gaming Popularity for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-of-the-samsung-galaxy-fit-elevate-your-workout-experience/"><u>Comprehensive Review of the Samsung Galaxy Fit: Elevate Your Workout Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/pet-cube-revolutionizes-long-distance-animal-care/"><u>Pet Cube Revolutionizes Long-Distance Animal Care</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-verdict-on-apples-updated-affordable-tablet-a-complete-look-at-the-latest-9th-gen-ipad-102/"><u>The Ultimate Verdict on Apple's Updated Affordable Tablet - A Complete Look at the Latest 9Th Gen iPad (10.2)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/unlocking-the-power-of-smart-lock-a-beginners-guide-for-motorola-razr-40-users-by-drfone-android/"><u>Unlocking the Power of Smart Lock A Beginners Guide for Motorola Razr 40 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-benefits-of-the-google-pixel-4a-a-smart-choice-for-casual-users/"><u>Unveiling the Benefits of the Google Pixel 4A: A Smart Choice for Casual Users</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
