Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Finding a good, modern flight simulator these days doesn’t leave you with too many options. You could always stick with the classics like Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX), but what if you want something that can fully take advantage of your new gaming rig or high-end graphics card?</p><p> This is where Laminar Research comes in with their next-gen X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator—a modern take on flight sims built for more<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >current hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . While many popular flight simulators are starting to show their age, X-Plane 11 is a breath of fresh air in the genre, and a breathtaking one at that. Read our review below to see how the latest X-Plane release stacks up against classics like FSX.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KBuJiu3GVH9R41cibSGIkcK_7hs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW840502X-Plane11FlightSim_04-9dedb800bd1340e19901349ee3ca3bda.jpg"                      alt="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531879">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531879">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531879%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531879/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Preflight-checklist"><a href="#Setup-Process-Preflight-checklist" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Preflight checklist"></a><strong>Setup Process: Preflight checklist</strong></h2><p> Currently, the game is available to be purchased from a number of online retailers in either disc or digital download format. We opted to go the old-school route and purchased the game in a pack of discs, so we’ll cover this option, but if you want to grab the software online, the steps are mostly the same (even simpler).</p><p> With the complete disc booklet in hand, your first order of business will be to make sure you’ve got the space. We did mention that X-Plane 11 sports some stunning visuals, and that means lots of space is needed to store all those details. The game requires a whopping 60GB of free space, so hopefully, you’ve got some extra room on your drive.</p><p> Begin by placing the first disc into your internal or external DVD drive. The installer will start automatically and it’s easy to follow the on-screen prompts. You’ll need to swap out the discs one after the other as the instructions indicate until you complete the setup.</p><p> While many popular flight simulators are starting to show their age, X-Plane 11 is a breath of fresh air in the genre, and a breathtaking one at that.</p><p> Once your software is fully set up, you can now launch the game and get yourself flying. Be sure to adjust the settings in the menu to your specific setup for things like resolution, quality, controls, etc.</p><p> Aside from setting up your game, it’s a good idea to connect your HOTAS during the initial setup. A HOTAS, or “hands-on throttle-and-stick,” is a set of peripherals that allow you to control your in-game aircraft with more realistic inputs. Combining one of these with X-Plane 11 will increase the immersion considerably.</p><p> There are a number of these to choose from, but we went with the Thrustmaster T16000M FCS HOTAS which includes the added pedals. This unit is one of the more popular, affordable options, so we’ll briefly discuss how to set it up. Beginning with the obvious, connect all the cables to your computer’s USB ports. Don’t forget to connect the pedals to the throttle with the included cable.</p><p> Once you’ve got it hooked up, Windows should recognize the device and download the necessary drivers. When those have completed installing, you should be able to see the HOTAS connected in X-Plane 11 under the control settings. You’ll also be able to fine-tune things based on your preference from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O9MXEQGpCTKXA5qNcF6nXai8L2o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW840502X-Plane11FlightSim_03-90ad9c4205af48bcbd8fcc163c630a5a.jpg"                      alt="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Gameplay-As-close-as-you-can-get-to-flying-a-plane-in-your-home"><a href="#Gameplay-As-close-as-you-can-get-to-flying-a-plane-in-your-home" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: As close as you can get to flying a plane in your home"></a><strong>Gameplay: As close as you can get to flying a plane in your home</strong></h2><p> Booting up X-Plane 11, you’re greeted with a host of available options to choose from before your flight. While not nearly as deep as FSX, there are a lot of things you can pick between. If you’re just getting started, the Flight School will teach you the basics of flight in the game and allow you to get acclimated. If you’re not a newcomer, however, you can jump straight into the plane and environment of your choosing.</p><p> X-Plane 11 allows you to choose from a limited range of aircraft like basic prop planes to huge jumbo jets (though you can purchase more in the form of DLC). For environments, there are lots of major airports and cities to pick, and you can either select custom weather effects or go with real-world conditions updated in real-time. These options allow for a good bit of diversity, but there aren’t a ton of cool custom missions aimed at simply having fun as you’d see in FSX (no landing planes on moving buses here). The game is definitely more geared for the enthusiast who wants to replicate true to life experiences.</p><p> Users also have the ability to fine-tune their aircraft’s specs, with options for weight, fuel level and more, allowing for some interesting setups. The menus in X-Plane 11 have been more streamlined overall versus previous installations of the series, which is a welcome addition. That said, they can quickly become too complex for basic users.</p><p> The game is definitely more geared for the enthusiast who wants to replicate true to life experiences.</p><p> Jumping into a session, the gameplay feels solid, with tons of immersion and a fully clickable cockpit for each plane. You can choose to make these as complicated as you like, but the realism here is top-notch. Taxing your small Cessna across the airport of Hong Kong with the bright lights of the city all around you at night, and taking off into the sky feels awesome—about as close as you can get to flying a plane in your house.</p><p> While testing out X-Plane 11, we did experience some issues, but more so in the graphics department than the gameplay itself, which we’ll touch on in the next section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GF7rAjDnQ1m4Lngb7N3ShcMRA6U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW840502X-Plane11FlightSim_05-4039c04a1e16492e8b1c6024167e28f8.jpg"                      alt="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139111/17108" target="_top" id="2139111">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139111" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139111/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Breathtaking-visuals-but-subpar-optimization"><a href="#Graphics-Breathtaking-visuals-but-subpar-optimization" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Breathtaking visuals, but subpar optimization"></a><strong>Graphics: Breathtaking visuals, but subpar optimization</strong></h2><p> With such a monster storage requirement, it’s no surprise that the details and graphics in X-Plane 11 are pretty remarkable. Planes themselves are the focus here, so the textures are superb. Also because Laminar chose to focus on fewer aircraft overall, the ones they’ve included all feel exceptionally well fleshed out. That tradeoff might not appeal to those who want hundreds of vehicles to select from, but it does make the selection in the game quite impressive.</p><p> Cities like New York City feature not just accurate buildings, but traffic and road layouts that really add to the experience of a living, breathing world below you.</p><p> Aside from the planes themselves, the environments you pick from feel great, with realistic cities properly laid out to their real-world counterparts. Cities like New York City feature not just accurate buildings, but traffic and road layouts that really add to the experience of a living, breathing world below you.</p><p> The skybox is an important one for flight simulators, and while X-Plane 11 improves over predecessors, it isn’t the best either. Clouds themselves are a particular eyesore, even with the settings turned up. Weather, on the other hand, looks splendid, with rain creating streaks on your windows and falling all around in spectacular fashion.</p><p> Another particularly bad graphical element is the trees. They’re one-dimensional and stick out in an otherwise beautiful environment. This is a bit of a disappointment, but isn’t a huge issue when you’re up in the air away from them.</p><p> One of the highlights of the visuals in X-Plane is the lighting. It’s high-quality and realistic, creating some incredible moments depending on your environment. Night flights are especially beautiful in the game, which has long been a favorite among fans of the franchise.</p><p> Perhaps the biggest issue is the optimization. It’s not very good, which can lead to some frustrating experiences. Even running on our PC with a high-end graphics card and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-cpu-2618150" >CPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , we had some instances of stuttering and frame drops (though nothing horrid). While turning down the settings can remedy this somewhat, the setup we were using shouldn’t have an issue and is a clear indication of poor optimization. For lower-end users or those looking to run the game off integrated graphics, you’ll likely have a crippling experience in performance, even when the graphics are low. The RAM requirements are also quite high, recommending 16GB, which puts it on par with AAA games.</p><p> Perhaps the biggest issue overall with the game is the optimization. It’s not very good and can lead to some frustrating experiences.</p><p> Lastly, we do recommend running the game on an SSD if you can, as HDDs are known to create annoying pop-ins while loading landscapes during flights.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vw51Z13aohls1Ebaej2J6l1z-0E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW840502X-Plane11FlightSim_02-ae4e2d16b4db412aaa3e933fd3dfc7ab.jpg"                      alt="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947746/11832" target="_top" id="947746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947746/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027162/19272" target="_top" id="2027162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027162/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-In-line-with-modern-games-but-pricey-DLC-not-included"><a href="#Price-In-line-with-modern-games-but-pricey-DLC-not-included" class="headerlink" title="Price: In line with modern games, but pricey DLC not included"></a><strong>Price: In line with modern games, but pricey DLC not included</strong></h2><p> Because X-Plane 11 is a relatively newer game, the price is what you’d expect from most current AAA titles. The game is currently priced at about $60-70 depending on where you purchase it, so it’s not exactly cheap, but it is average for the market.</p><p> The biggest issue is that the X-Plane, like most other simulators, has an endless list of DLC that can quickly add up if you want to get everything possible in the package. While these aren’t necessary to enjoy the game by any means, they will add replayability and offer additional experiences if you’re willing to stomach the costs.</p><p> Without a doubt, X-Plane 11 is the best current-generation flight simulator you can currently purchase.</p><p> One nice feature with X-Plane is that you do have the option to install mods. These free packs of user-generated content can really spice things up by providing custom aircraft and environments if you’re looking to add content without adding more money. They aren’t as numerous as the mod options for FSX, but they’re there if you want them.</p><h2 id="X-Plane-11-Global-Flight-Simulator-vs-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-X"><a href="#X-Plane-11-Global-Flight-Simulator-vs-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-X" class="headerlink" title="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator vs. Microsoft Flight Simulator X"></a><strong>X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator vs. Microsoft Flight Simulator X</strong></h2><p> Comparing a classic staple in flight simulators like FSX to a more modern one like X-Plane 11 might feel a bit strange, but these two games are the most popular around even today. Given that FSX is about a decade older than X-Plane 11, you’ll need to understand that there are some big differences in terms of modernization between the two.</p><p> Despite its age, FSX is still a very capable sim, offering an unmatched amount of content, DLC, and mods to users looking for the absolute content. There’s something to be said for a game as old as FSX that’s still getting support and love from the fanbase. Even X-Plane 11 can’t hold a torch to the amount of replayability FSX offers.</p><p> However, X-Plane 11_is_ more modern, and that means you get a host of improvements over older simulators. The graphics will look much improved, environments are more current, the support will likely be better in years to come, and the gameplay feels tighter due to the vast advancements in tech. X-Plane 11 offers a next-gen experience that FSX will never come close to.</p><p> If your primary deciding factor is visuals, X-Plane is your go-to. If you want more content, well FSX is unmatched in that department. The price is also a bit better with FSX, but each of these titles will quickly add up if you want to get all the DLC available.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-x-gold-edition-review-4776936" >Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The best current-gen flight simulator available now.</strong></p><p> Without a doubt, X-Plane 11 is the best current-generation flight simulator you can buy.

The camera itself has a plastic, silver housing with a shiny silver focus ring on the end. It feels like it could break at any moment. The base is made of a transparent plastic, which is also available in blue and black. The plastic is so rigid that we expect it to break under regular use. Every time we adjusted the camera, the plastic creaked like a rusty door in a haunted house. Even in our short testing period, the joints started getting loose. We had to check several times just to make sure it wasn’t broken.</p><p> The base looks like a binder clip with a hinge on the back end. The front of the camera houses the focus ring, which twists to focus in or out but doesn’t turn very smoothly. When we used it for the first time, it didn’t feel like it was supposed to rotate at all. Just like everything else, the focus ring feels like it will crack or fall out at any moment. One side of the clip has a squishy pad to keep the camera from slipping when it’s mounted on a smooth surface. The two are connected by a ball joint, which allows the camera to spin around 360 degrees and tilt approximately 15 degrees forward or backward or side to side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a_8Gd66JN0RtfWzKKcRq95S8EmY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_6_Final_Horiz-1dd3a45479614483b0f4f5883f27094a.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Setup-process-Awkward-to-position"><a href="#Setup-process-Awkward-to-position" class="headerlink" title="Setup process: Awkward to position"></a><strong>Setup process: Awkward to position</strong></h2><p> It takes almost no time to get the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel up and running. We just plugged the USB cord into the computer and it worked.</p><p> It was easy to set up when we clipped it to a laptop, but terrible when we tried to put it on our HD TV. Every time we moved the computer or the USB cable, the camera slid, twisted, or fell off the TV. The ball joint, which connects the camera to the base, didn’t move smoothly, so we struggled to point the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel in the right direction, and we were too worried about breaking the plastic to try and force it.</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that. We tested the resolution by taking photos through photobooth, and they were only 640 x 480, or .31 megapixels. We tested the video resolution by using an online webcam testing tool, and it showed exactly the same results. The manufacturer claims the camera has 38 times more resolution than it actually does. We should have known that the manufacturer’s claims were too good to be true given the $8 asking price, but claiming a disparity that huge is really brazen.</p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that.</p><p> We tested the camera’s field of view by placing it 13.5 inches from a wall and measuring the field of view, 8.25 inches. After running those measurements through some trigonometric calculations, we found that it has a 34 degree field of view. The camera also has a surprising amount of distortion. Vertical lines in the background had a significant tilt backwards, and we saw tremendous barrel distortion everywhere except for the very center of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BxI5asxQavdUO5cT3iIpSIqM9Mk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_10_Final_Horiz-8acc6be9290c439496f17a63684115ae.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144285/7443" target="_top" id="2144285">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144285" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144285/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio"><a href="#Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio"></a><strong>Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio</strong></h2><p> We used<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test out the video and audio performance using the webcam for recording and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/top-free-web-conferencing-tools-2377241" >conference calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It was difficult to position the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel correctly, because by the time we clipped it on and sat down, the camera had slipped out of position. This happened several times before we finally resigned ourselves to using a tilted camera in our calls.</p><p> The limited field of view and the distortions weren’t a problem when we tried a single-person call, but it would be a big problem for a group. It would be difficult to get everyone into the picture unless your table was very narrow and far away from the camera.</p><p> The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><p> We had trouble getting the focus right, too. The focus ring was hard to turn, so we had to put our hand over the lense to get a good grip. We turned the ring a little, and then we’d pull away to check the focus. Then we’d repeat until it was ready, a frustrating experience.</p><p> The audio performance of the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel was also lackluster. The built-in microphone produced poor quality sound, and when we tested it on Skype, voices were both muffled and echoey. People on the other end could understand what we were saying, but it was an unpleasant experience.</p><h2 id="Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam"><a href="#Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam" class="headerlink" title="Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam"></a><strong>Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is the most inexpensive webcam you can buy, ranging from $8 up to around $15, but there’s a reason it’s priced so low. The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><h2 id="Competition-Falls-short"><a href="#Competition-Falls-short" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Falls short"></a><strong>Competition: Falls short</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Logitech C270</em> :</strong> The Logitech C270 is a low-cost webcam that goes for $40 MSRP, though you can frequently find it for approximately $20. For $10 more than the Docooler, you get a big upgrade. It has 720p video calling and takes photos at 3MP. The microphone filters out background noise, so it shouldn’t have the same echo effects as the Docooler Web Cam. Even though it’s twice the price, you get a lot more camera for your ten bucks.</p><p><strong><em>HXSJ USB Webcam 480P HD</em> :</strong> We were most disappointed with the false claims about the Docooler webcam’s resolution, but HXSJ sells what looks like the same camera with honest advertising. In fact, the design, the frame, and just about everything else looks nearly identical to the Docooler webcam. Even the price is close to the same. We think the honest claims about the HXSJ should be rewarded, so we’d definitely recommend buying this camera over the Docooler.</p><p><strong><em>Coromose USB 50MP HD</em> :</strong> The Coromose USB 50MP HD looks exactly like the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel, down to the last detail. The base and camera look exactly alike, even the writing on the focus ring, and they go for about the same price, $8. There is no way, however, that this camera can do 50MP. It’s the same camera saddled even more egregious, deceptive marketing.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Impossible to recommend.</strong></p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is one of the most inexpensive cameras on the market for a reason. This camera doesn’t come close to delivering what it promises, meaning it’s not worth even the trifle you’d pay for it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134246/18498" target="_top" id="2134246">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134246" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134246/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  USB 2.0 12 Megapixel</li><li>Product Brand  Docooler</li><li>UPC  B00OB883F6</li><li>Price  $8.00</li><li>Weight  2.5 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.75 x 1.5 x 3 in.</li><li>Color  Transparent, blue, black</li><li>Connections  USB 2.0 A cord 56.25” long</li><li>Aperture  F&#x2F;2 - F&#x2F;4</li><li>Focus  Manual Focus 8mm to infinity</li><li>Field of vision  34 degrees</li><li>Resolution  640 x 480; 12 MP claimed, 0.31 MP tested</li><li>Frame rate  30fps</li><li>What’s Included  Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel, Quick Start Guide</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-harnessing-digital-power-for-maximum-outreach/"><u>[New] In 2024, Harnessing Digital Power for Maximum Outreach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-weavers-codex-looms-screen-capture-secrets/"><u>[Updated] The Weaver’s Codex Loom's Screen Capture Secrets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/1-unboxing-the-latest-rog-alphax-a-mid-generation-revamp-anticipating-future-upgrades/"><u>1.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses roughly the same design as many of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, and it didn’t give the absolute best results either. Nonetheless, it’s still going to be the best choice for a really large segment of buyers out there simply because of how aggressively its priced.</p><p> If you are living inside of a large metropolitan area, you likely don’t need the best possible antenna to pick up the channels being broadcast to you over the air. Furthermore, I didn’t see that big of a difference in performance as price increased. Unless you step it all the way up to a much larger, much more expensive solution, the difference in performance is probably not worth it, which is why the 1byone is an easy recommendation. Let’s see how it performed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FEdsHVNn7IxwxXsSkRT0jxmmRuQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_02-d797d473ec154becbab8a3023cff8b53.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Vanilla"><a href="#Design-Vanilla" class="headerlink" title="Design: Vanilla"></a><strong>Design: Vanilla</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses a flat rectangular design similar to other powered indoor antennas on the market. The 13.25 x 9.25 inch antenna surface is roughly in line with most of the other products I looked at in this category, the only real difference being that the 1byone has a much more rigid surface.</p><p> Being a powered antenna, the 1byone uses an external amplifier to boost the signal. This box contains a coaxial input attached via the included 16.5ft cable, and has a power input, which can be supplied by the TV itself if it can support USB power. Otherwise, 1byone includes a USB power adapter.</p><h2 id="Setup-Fairly-intuitive"><a href="#Setup-Fairly-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Fairly intuitive"></a><strong>Setup: Fairly intuitive</strong></h2><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas. Simply attach the 16.5ft coaxial cable to the external amplifier, connect the power to a USB power source, and then attach the coaxial cable from the amplifier to your TV.</p><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Performance-Good-enough-for-most"><a href="#Performance-Good-enough-for-most" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Good enough for most"></a><strong>Performance: Good enough for most</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna didn’t have the best performance of the antennas we’ve tested, falling somewhere in the middle of the pack. In my channel acquisition test, I averaged 59 channels across all the tests performed. This compares to the worst performing antenna at just 47, and the best at 76.</p><p> This should be more than suitable for most people living within a city in relatively close proximity to the source of the TV signal. As for those living further, your mileage may vary.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934138/19272" target="_top" id="1934138">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934138" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934138/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Middle-of-the-road"><a href="#Range-Middle-of-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Range: Middle of the road"></a><strong>Range: Middle of the road</strong></h2><p> 1byone makes no specific promises about the range of their antenna, although they do cite users having positive experiences from as far as 48 miles away in their customer testimonials. Given how many factors impact the effective range, I think it is somewhat wise not to make any promises. Nonetheless, this is clearly a device that will be best suited for people living in or near major metropolitan areas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6y-ITpY8n7xf8BteMqdJjYm-paU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_05-178a02351af040cc89c86169b88a6de2.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-A-great-deal"><a href="#Price-A-great-deal" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great deal"></a><strong>Price: A great deal</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna costs just $25, making it the least expensive option out of the antennas I tested. It picked up all the major channels that I would actually watch, and didn’t have any issues with the signal. So from my perspective, why would I pay more? I think buyers would probably be best served by seeing if an antenna like this works for them. If you discover you need something more substantial, feel free to move on to a pricier option.</p><h2 id="1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna"><a href="#1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna"></a><strong>1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> Another popular manufacturer is Mohu, and the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna offers a simpler, non-amplified solution that only loses out on a hair of performance versus the 1byone. I preferred the build quality of the Mohu Leaf, if only marginally, and like the simplicity of not needing additional wires and boxes hanging out of my TV.</p><p> At the end of the day though, the 1byone performs better and costs less money, so it’s not the easiest argument to make.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The overall best value.</strong></p><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna offers the best value out of all the indoor antennas that we tested. If you can get the performance you need from the 1byone, it’s the antenna to buy.

D-Link’s Powerline AV2000 is a more affordable alternative that provides a wired connection over your home’s electrical wiring. It isn’t quite as fast as connecting via Ethernet cable, but it’s the next best thing.</p><p> While the Powerline AV2000’s specifications are impressive, they don’t always tell the whole story. That’s why we took a pair of these adapters, plugged them in, and tested them to see if they work as well as advertised. We checked things like how easy they are to set up, whether they’re likely to get in the way of other electronics, real-world transfer speeds, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/plySecBvduGkJXsaWpMzfgOg7gU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4141215-04-01bd7072d50949398973fb514e2ea95c.jpg"                      alt="D-Link Powerline AV2000 Passthrough DHP-P701AV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082533/7443" target="_top" id="2082533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Smaller-than-its-predecessor-but-still-bulky"><a href="#Design-Smaller-than-its-predecessor-but-still-bulky" class="headerlink" title="Design: Smaller than its predecessor, but still bulky"></a><strong>Design: Smaller than its predecessor, but still bulky</strong></h2><p> D-Link’s Powerline AV2000 is more about function than form. The design is minimalistic almost to a fault, with a basic, white, plastic body, a few indicator LEDs, an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a sync button, and an electrical pass-through. It’s also available in a slightly larger version that costs a bit less and doesn’t come with the pass-through.</p><p> Due to the bulky nature of this powerline adapter, the pass-through is a nice touch. The version of the Powerline AV2000 that doesn’t include a pass-through is big enough to block electrical outlets above and to either side, depending on your outlet configuration, making it a bit of a pain to use in a lot of situations.</p><p> Since you can’t plug these into a power strip without suffering a massive hit to data transfer speeds, it’s really nice to have the option to plug a power strip or any other device into the pass-through. Out test unit included the pass-through, and we highly recommend spending the extra money to get the version of the hardware with this feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xx_XMhVtfwHDrdQV9zP4xFm4PkA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4141215-02-4ccab309a3564682aefbd0a48f39355f.jpg"                      alt="D-Link Powerline AV2000 Passthrough DHP-P701AV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-special-knowledge-or-tools-required"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-special-knowledge-or-tools-required" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: No special knowledge or tools required"></a><strong>Setup Process: No special knowledge or tools required</strong></h2><p> Setting up a wired network with a set of D-Link Powerline AV2000 adapters requires absolutely no networking experience or knowledge. The setup process requires you to plug one adapter into your modem or router with an included Ethernet cable, plug the other adapter into your computer, game console, or any other device that has an Ethernet port, and then plug both adapters into power.</p><p> Setting up a wired network with a set of D-Link Powerline AV2000 adapters requires absolutely no networking experience or knowledge.</p><p> Once you have the adapters plugged in, they automatically detect each other and establish a network connection. You can verify that this process is in progress by watching the LEDs on each adapter, which will light up when the device is powered on, when a network connection is established between the adapters, and when a connection is established between the adapter and the device it’s connected to via ethernet cable.</p><p> Each Powerline AV2000 adapter also includes a button that you can press to establish a secure connection. This isn’t necessary, but it’s still very easy. To get started, you push the button on one adapter for two seconds. You then have two minutes to press the corresponding button on the other adapter. The adapters will then established a secure connection using 128-bit AES encryption.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/X0oLXEoZMMDp1yHZ4thpEvAY2Sk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4141215-05-29cdfecba8e74dc9a126aff93f29b3ce.jpg"                      alt="D-Link Powerline AV2000 Passthrough DHP-P701AV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528693/16446" target="_top" id="1528693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528693/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-HomePlug-AV2-with-MIMO"><a href="#Connectivity-HomePlug-AV2-with-MIMO" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: HomePlug AV2 with MIMO"></a><strong>Connectivity: HomePlug AV2 with MIMO</strong></h2><p> D-Link Powerline AV2000 adapters use the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/powerline-home-networking-and-homeplug-817720" >HomePlug AV2 specification <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , so they’re nominally compatible with other AV2 devices.

That’s not exactly gigabit, and speeds drop off significantly when the adapters are plugged into different circuits, but it’s still one of the fastest powerline adapters we’ve tested.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IXQZNi3pFRjm2tdKfPMhwxTE-DA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4141215-06-5a298aa4450e4adfb249aeae86330406.jpg"                      alt="D-Link Powerline AV2000 Passthrough DHP-P701AV"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123732/7443" target="_top" id="2123732">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123732" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123732/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006914/19272" target="_top" id="2006914">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006914" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006914/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-D-Link-PLC-utility-available-online"><a href="#Software-D-Link-PLC-utility-available-online" class="headerlink" title="Software: D-Link PLC utility available online"></a><strong>Software: D-Link PLC utility available online</strong></h2><p> These devices are plug and play, so most users won’t ever have to worry about software, and there is no software included in the box. If you ever do need to change any settings or update the firmware, you can download a PLC utility from D-Link’s official website.</p><p> The D-Link PLC utility has to be run on a Windows PC that’s connected to the same network as your Powerline AV2000 adapters. It’s fairly simple and provides a few management and testing tools. You can update the firmware of your adapters to the latest version, pinpoint a malfunctioning system, change the encryption key used by your devices, or provide custom names for each adapter.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424529">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424529">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424529%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424529/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-On-the-expensive-side-of-the-scale"><a href="#Price-On-the-expensive-side-of-the-scale" class="headerlink" title="Price: On the expensive side of the scale"></a><strong>Price: On the expensive side of the scale</strong></h2><p> The D-Link Powerline AV2000 adapters are priced on the upper end of the scale for similarly equipped adapters. The version that doesn’t come with a pass-through has an MSRP of $130 and usually sells in the $100 range. The pass-through version that we tested has an MSRP of $160 and usually sells for around $110.</p><p> The typical street price for these adapters is pretty close to the competition, but the MSRP is significantly more expensive. Since some competitors, like Extollo, make adapters that are even faster than these, it’s likely that you’re primarily paying for the brand name rather than better performance.</p><h2 id="Competition-Beats-most-of-the-competition-but-doesn’t-come-out-on-top"><a href="#Competition-Beats-most-of-the-competition-but-doesn’t-come-out-on-top" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Beats most of the competition, but doesn’t come out on top"></a><strong>Competition: Beats most of the competition, but doesn’t come out on top</strong></h2><p> The D-Link Powerline AV2000 adapters beat most competitors in terms of sheer performance, and the slightly higher price tag is mostly justified by high transfer speeds and reliable connections. The main exception is the Extollo LANSocket 1500, which was a bit faster in our tests, and has an MSRP of just $90.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/extollo-lansocket-1500-review-4778158" >Extollo LANSocket 1500 Powerline Adapter Kit Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Compared to the Netgear PowerLINE 2000, with an MSRP of $85, the D-Link Powerline AV2000 comes out on top in terms of transfer speed. However, the difference might not be enough to justify the price gap, especially if you have a home internet connection that’s on the slower side.</p><p> The TP-Link AV2000 is another competitor that has a theoretical top speed of 2Gbps, but falls short of that in real-world testing. It’s also a bit slower than the D-Link Powerline AV2000, and doesn’t have an electrical pass-through, but it’s also less expensive with an MSRP of $90.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tp-link-av2000-powerline-adapter-review-4775701" >TP-Link AV2000 Powerline Adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Buy it on sale, but take a pass otherwise.</strong></p><p> The D-Link Powerline AV2000 is a great powerline adapter, but it isn’t the best. We found that these adapters are extremely easy to set up and use, and they provide fast transfer speeds, but there are alternatives that are both faster and less expensive. If you can find a pair on sale, then the price concern goes out the window, and this is a great product to own. Otherwise, take a look at the Extollo LANSocket 1500, which is both faster and less expensive.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  DHP-P701AV Powerline AV2000</li><li>Product Brand  D-Link</li><li>UPC  DHP-P701AV</li><li>Price  $109.99</li><li>Weight  11.5 oz.</li><li>Speed  2000 Mbps (theoretical)</li><li>Warranty  One year (hardware)</li><li>Compatibility  HomePlug AV2</li><li>MIMO  Yes</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  One</li><li>Parental Controls  No</li><li>Encryption  128-bit AES</li><li>Power saving mode  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-blueprint-for-crafting-standout-podcast-titles-and-name-samples/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate Blueprint for Crafting Standout Podcast Titles & Name Samples</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-accelerating-your-ascension-to-instagram-a-list-status-our-fast-track-guide-of-15-must-try-strategies-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Accelerating Your Ascension to Instagram A-List Status Our Fast Track Guide of 15 Must-Try Strategies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-advanced-tech-webcams-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-top-5-with-sound/"><u>[Updated] Advanced Tech Webcams -

No, it wasn’t the most powerful headset out there, using a two-year-old smartphone processor to power its games and experiences, but it was a capable, completely self-contained, wireless VR headset that didn’t require a PC or game console to deliver stellar immersion.</p><p> It was one of last year’s greatest new gadgets, and now Oculus has returned with a sequel. The Oculus Quest 2 is smaller and lighter, yet more powerful and with a much better screen—yet it costs $100 less than the original. How did that happen? Well, it’s not all great news, thanks to a couple of cost-cutting measures that you’ll feel and potentially see, but the end result is ultimately a better and more affordable device that serves as an ideal gateway into VR.</p><h2 id="Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made"><a href="#Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made" class="headerlink" title="Design and Comfort: Compromises were made"></a>Design and Comfort: Compromises were made</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 sticks to the familiar modern VR playbook as a module that you strap onto your face to immerse yourself within its digital worlds but features some different material and construction choices than the original. Unfortunately, the design choices largely are not upgrades compared to the original headset</p><p> Noticeably, the module itself doesn’t jut out as far from your face as before, plus it has a white plastic finish rather than the black fabric-lined exterior of the original. It also weighs less, which is a good thing for a device that hangs off of your face: it comes in at 503g compared to 571g with the original Quest.</p><p> However, the shallower depth of the module makes an impact for someone like me who must wear glasses while using the Quest 2.</p><p> Even with the included, optional glasses spacer, which adds a couple extra millimeters between the lenses and where the padded visor presses against your face, the inside felt much tighter against my glasses. It can be tricky to get the Quest 2 on without my eyelashes brushing against my lenses.</p><p> But that’s also due in part to the new fabric strap system, which is less effective than the rubber, dome-like strap from the first Quest. That previous strap did a better job of cupping the back of your head to offset the weight of the module itself and keep it comfortably strapped to your head, but these loose, adjustable fabric straps aren’t nearly as secure. It took me longer to get the headset on and in a comfortable position, and I couldn’t find the same kind of sweet spot as before.</p><p> Oculus now sells a $49 Elite Strap attachment that’s more akin to the original Quest strap, and while the Quest 2 straps are usable, I’ll probably make the upgrade and buy the better strap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JkgQv_Sk0ofSL0Sp-jKmqe84xak=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-2-a7792535288542dba45c8bc32f882be2.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Rift 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks"><a href="#Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks"></a>Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 uses the same kind of “inside-out” tracking system that relies on four cameras on the visor to track the wireless controllers or even your hands, rather than relying on external tracking sensors as some PC-based systems do. Like the original, it works amazingly well, allowing for fluid, six-degrees-of-freedom movement in games and minimizing both initial setup and the time it takes to get going each session. It also means that you can use the Oculus Quest 2_anywhere_ without the need for any kind of external hardware or accessories.</p><p> The Quest 2’s wireless, motion-sensing Oculus Touch controllers are identical in function to the original, but are a little heavier and have a larger surface with space to rest your thumb when not in use. That’s handy. Each has an analog stick and two face buttons, along with a trigger button and a grip button. Oculus also swapped out the magnetically-attached battery doors from the first Quest controllers—which would sometimes slide open when I used the original—for ones that simply click into place. That’s a win for function over form.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1aG6kdNHMuvnim8p8_i1RwH9QG8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-3-eec6cabc11db4ed9be5254aa2bc46ec1.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/999558/11832" target="_top" id="999558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-999558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/999558/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> But there is a potential loss for function and comfort with one other particular aspect of the headset itself: IPD adjustment. Inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is the physical distance between your eyes, and a headset must account for it to effectively deliver clear, 3D experiences. On the original Quest, a physical slider let you precisely adjust the distance to match your own face. With the Quest 2, however, there are just three settings, and you can physically shift the placement of the lenses to choose the position that is closest to your own.</p><p> If your IPD matches or is very close to one of the settings (58mm, 63mm, 68mm), then you’re all set. If not, then you may notice that the image isn’t as clear as you’d like, and it could potentially lead to headaches if you can’t find a pretty good sweet spot. In my case, my IPD is close enough to the middle setting to be OK, but it doesn’t feel as spot-on as it did on the original Quest using the slider. It might help knock down the price of the headset, but that’s a quality-of-life downgrade that will affect some people significantly more than others.</p><p> That might sound like a lot of griping, but it’s only because some of the key physical design changes on the Quest 2 feel like compromises or downgrades. But for most people, they won’t be significant impediments. And if you’re coming to the new headset without ever using the original Quest, then you should be fine—the new straps are usable, but they aren’t as effective or effortlessly adjustable as before. Luckily, the Quest 2 makes significant strides elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gwWuuSfTzWNDoS45b-iG9qG32-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-4-27f169e7e71b4372a38e13332b7b1364.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook"></a>Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook</h2><p> You should charge the Oculus Quest 2 out of the box, as the modest total battery life means a partially-charged headset isn’t going to last very long. You will need a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , either Android or iPhone, and the free Oculus app to complete setup, as well. Once the headset has a good charge, begin setup from the mobile app and then follow the guided directions, which will involve putting on, adjusting, and getting familiar with the headset itself.</p><p> Part of the setup process, and the process each time you use the headset, is to designate your play space by “drawing” a barrier within the augmented view of your surroundings seen through the headset’s cameras. From there, the headset determines whether you have enough space for active, room-scale experiences, or you can choose a stationary setup for seated play modes. During active play, a virtual barrier called the Oculus Guardian appears when you get close to the edges of your designated play space to help you avoid crashing into your surroundings. It’s all rather clever and effective.</p><p> There’s one other potential hitch with the Oculus Quest 2 that wasn’t present with the original: the new headset_requires_ a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tutorial-how-facebook-works-2654610" >Facebook account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and there’s no way around it. Facebook owns Oculus, and while the first Quest could be used simply with an Oculus account, the new one requires the social media account. For some, that may be a deal-breaker, given frustrations over privacy and the increasing role that Facebook plays in our society, so just know that going in.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868499/19272" target="_top" id="1868499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868499/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade"><a href="#Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It’s a big upgrade"></a>Performance: It’s a big upgrade</h2><p> The original Oculus Quest did a fine job of delivering immersive VR experiences that didn’t feel compromised or significantly downgraded, even if it didn’t hit the same visual peaks as pricier, PC-powered headsets. And it was pretty amazing that the Quest did so with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, a chip found in 2017’s flagship smartphones.</p><p> The Oculus Quest 2 takes things to another level, and there are a few reasons why.</p><p> First off, the new Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chip here is based on the current Snapdragon 865 chip seen in phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Note20, and is three generations newer than the old chip.</p><p> It’s also paired with 50 percent more RAM (6GB) than the original Quest. Even more vividly, the fast-switching LCD screen packs in nearly 50 percent more pixels per eye than the old OLED panels did, for a noticeably crisper and smoother experience.</p><p> On the first Quest, you got 1440x1600 resolution per eye: solid, but a bit fuzzy and comparatively lower resolution than some of the PC headsets on the market. Here, however, the single screen provides 1832x1920 per eye, and the difference is obvious. While the switch from OLED to LCD technology should weaken the contrast a bit and dampen the deep black levels, I’ll be honest: I didn’t notice.</p><p> What I did notice was sharper interfaces and smoother action, with more fluid-feeling experiences that exhibited fewer of the occasional-yet-tolerable hitches seen with some games and apps on the first Quest headset.</p><p> Additionally, Oculus recently enabled the Quest 2 to hit a peak 90Hz screen refresh rate, up from 72Hz on the first headset, which will only help deliver that smoother-feeling usage. Developers must enable 90Hz within their apps and games, however.</p><p> I felt the Quest 2’s enhancements more prominently in some games over others. Laser sword-swinging music game Beat Saber, for example, ran well on the first headset and isn’t that different here—just smoother and clearer-looking. But with the online battle royale shooter Population: One, the cleaner-looking textures and more fluid performance helped mitigate some of the light motion sickness I felt playing on the first Quest.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones"></a>Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones</h2><p> Plugging in headphones delivers a more closed-off, immersive experience, but the Oculus Quest 2’s built-in speaker does a solid job of delivering audio and music. It does sound a tiny bit louder and fuller than the original Quest’s speaker, but not significantly so. Still, if you want to play without being fully shut-off from your surroundings, it works just fine.</p><h2 id="Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours"><a href="#Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours" class="headerlink" title="Battery: You’ll get a couple hours"></a>Battery: You’ll get a couple hours</h2><p> Like the original headset, the Oculus Quest 2 is rated for 2-3 hours of usage on a full charge. For such a compact, standalone headset, I think that’s reasonable. You get a couple hours to play, and then you can take a breather and do other things while it charges.</p><p> That said, if you’re keen on longer-lasting experiences, Oculus sells a $129 version of the Elite Strap with a built-in battery pack that doubles the play time, or you can get a portable battery pack, plug it in, and stick it in your pocket during use. Lastly, you could just use a lengthy USB-C cable and plug yourself into a wall. If you’re doing room-scale VR games and apps with free movement, however, you’ll need something longer—like 10 feet or more. Otherwise, some seated apps and games will work just fine when you’re tethered to a nearby wall outlet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ns2S3DQVema5UEDDSO8n3N7SC_4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-7-0a0e40b6a3064fe7abc985f0900dbeff.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC"><a href="#Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC" class="headerlink" title="Software: Use the headset or connect to PC"></a>Software: Use the headset or connect to PC</h2><p> The headset’s own interface hasn’t changed much from the first Quest, taking place in a 3D home-like environment with floating menus that you can access via the motion controllers. It’s a pretty easy way to choose between your currently installed games and apps, install anything else in your library, purchase and download new content, and access video content including apps like Netflix, YouTube, and SlingTV.</p><p> Oculus has also enabled optional hand tracking, including the use of hand and finger gestures to get around the interface and interact with some games. Hand tracking is definitely more finicky than using the controllers, however, and you’ll need solid lighting to really rely on it. That said, it does still feel experimental, and I encountered enough misread gestures and incorrect interactions to make me want to stick to the controllers. They work reliably great.</p><p> Since the original Quest’s launch, Oculus added the ability to connect the headset to a powerful PC to run more advanced VR experiences, and that carries over to the Quest 2, as well. You’ll need a PC that is capable of running headsets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as either the official Oculus Link USB-C cable ($80) or a comparable USB 3.1 cable that can handle the high-speed demands. I bought an unofficial cable for half the price on Amazon, and it worked great.</p><p> Using a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, I was able to play the visually demanding and deeply immersive Half-Life: Alyx on the Oculus Quest 2—a game that it could never run using its own internal hardware. It ran a little less smoothly than it did using the PC-native Valve Index headset, but not significantly so. This is a great way to experience higher-end VR games, including the new<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/star-wars-squadrons-review-5086656" >Star Wars: Squadrons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , for example. And with Oculus announcing plans to phase out PC-only headsets, it will also be a key part of the Quest platform’s future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/72vxixVr7kdKoLfUC3QkIrBl26I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-6-12fcb6054cf2475191bc613a3f26bcfc.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The $299 edition of the headset comes with 64GB of internal storage and the $399 version nets you 256GB, with some of each tally taken up by system software and resources. Luckily, the games and apps themselves aren’t huge, typically weighing in between 1-4GB apiece, sometimes less, and they’re pretty quick to download again if you want to revisit something. The 64GB edition should provide enough space for most players, as you could probably comfortably have a dozen or more games installed, along with streaming media apps, but anyone who wants to have a robust VR library on hand at all times without waiting might consider spending the extra cash.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975836/19272" target="_top" id="1975836">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975836" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975836/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Games-A-good-growing-selection"><a href="#Games-A-good-growing-selection" class="headerlink" title="Games: A good, growing selection"></a>Games: A good, growing selection</h2><p> Although those aforementioned games and some others are still only found on PC (or maybe PlayStation VR on the PlayStation 4 or 5), the Oculus Quest platform has amassed a very nice selection of native games that you can download and play right on the headset.There is no difference in compatibility between the headsets: all Quest games play on Quest 2 and vice versa, just with performance differences.</p><p> Many of the early games from the impressive Quest launch lineup are still among the best games you can play on the Quest 2. The aforementioned Beat Saber, which finds you swinging your controllers to slash faux lightsabers through soaring rhythmic beats, is a frenetic blast, now with a larger library of songs including BTS and Linkin Park packs. Superhot VR is a stylish hybrid of a shooter and a puzzle game, of sorts, as you figure out how to clear through foes while avoiding incoming bullets that only move when you do. Meanwhile, the Star Wars VR game Vader Immortal still does a great job of creating an authentic atmosphere.</p><p> But there’s so much more now, too. Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite, both from developer Enhance Games, are trippy, trancelike experiences that you can sit down and really savor in VR. Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners and the aforementioned Population: One show that larger-scale shooter experiences can be immersive and compelling in VR, plus there’s a newer Star Wars game, Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge, that blends interactive storytelling with fun blaster battles.</p><p> There’s a lot of great stuff on Quest 2, ranging from simple arcade-like experiences to larger-scale adventures, quirky interactive experiences, and more. And on top of that, there are the aforementioned video services for 360-degree videos, plus fitness apps and games, VR chat for communicating with friends and random people, a web browser, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FqVvo044zoPghSD_PR1g2e0L2rs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-5-216bbf638cbe407b8b6f332abc94ae47.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Price-It’s-an-amazing-value"><a href="#Price-It’s-an-amazing-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s an amazing value"></a>Price: It’s an amazing value</h2><p> The Oculus Quest was already impressively priced at $399, so launching the more powerful Oculus Quest 2 at $299 is pretty phenomenal. Granted, the design compromises are a little frustrating, and I would’ve rather paid more for a better strap and more precise IPD settings like on the original—but those are the tweaks made to try and broaden the market for the Quest and VR as a whole. Still, even with those design annoyances, the Quest 2 is an incredible value for a portable, fully self-contained VR game console.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TDsFPvRGkhZaFzIaNnKRk1_xO4s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-8-Comparison-1b0c51b029da41389167e103a4c4843a.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977006">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977006.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977006">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977006.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977006%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977006/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037350/7443" target="_top" id="2037350">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037350" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037350/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR"></a>Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR</h2><p> Amazingly, there is no direct analog to the Oculus Quest 2 on the market: Oculus seems to be the only company that can release such a powerful device at this kind of price and with this kind of software support. That said, if I had to compare it to another VR headset, I’d put it up against Sony’s PlayStation VR, which requires a PlayStation 4 or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> console.</p><p> The PSVR is a few years old now and is technically overshadowed by the Quest 2 in terms of screen and controller quality. Still, Sony has amassed some stellar exclusive games thanks to its partnerships with game developers, and the PlayStation VR is a solid, reasonably affordable pickup for anyone who already has a PS4 or PS5 console and wants to dabble in VR. But if you don’t already have the console, and you want to get into VR, go for the dedicated Quest 2 instead. It’ll be cheaper than buying a headset and console together, plus it’s a better VR experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-vr-review-4692684" >Sony PlayStation VR Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The best VR device, all things considered.</strong></p><p> The significant performance upgrade and surprising price drop outweigh some of the annoying design shifts with the Oculus Quest 2, making it the must-have VR headset for just about everyone. Not only does it play a great library of on-headset games, but it can also connect to a powerful PC to play even more games on top of that. Add to that the ease of use, quality gameplay, and immersive visuals, and the Oculus Quest 2 is another brilliant VR game console.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-rift-s-review-4764112" >Oculus Rift S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-go-vr-headset-review-4690298" >Oculus Go Standalone VR Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135353/19272" target="_top" id="2135353">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135353" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135353/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Quest 2</li><li>Product Brand  Meta</li><li>UPC  815820021292</li><li>Price  $299.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2020</li><li>Weight  1.1 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.54 x 5.61 x 4.02 in.</li><li>Color  Gray</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Android 10</li><li>Processor  Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2</li><li>RAM  6GB</li><li>Storage  64GB&#x2F;256GB</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-prime-visual-screenshots-on-apple-systems-max-length-156/"><u>[Updated] Prime Visual Screenshots on Apple Systems (Max Length 156)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-beat-a-thon-essential-playlists-for-tiktoks-hot-rappers/"><u>2024 Approved Beat-a-Thon Essential Playlists for TikTok's Hot Rappers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/affordable-ssl-vendors-a-comprehensible-guide/"><u>Affordable SSL Vendors: A Comprehensible Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comparing-ps5-console-models-a-detailed-look-at-the-ps5-slim-vs-standard-ps5/"><u>Comparing PS5 Console Models: A Detailed Look at the PS5 Slim Vs.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Apple is no stranger to creating minimal devices, but the 21.5-inch 4K iMac takes things to a whole new level with a screen that pops and a design that looks stylish no matter the setting. As beautiful as it is on the outside, under the hood you also have a solid set of components with a 3.4GHz 7th generation quad-core Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB RAM, and 1TB Fusion Drive. Apple has managed to pack quite a bit of power inside the slender frame. We put it to the test to see how it fares for multimedia and productivity uses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TCcSm-nkER9HhHM8YIPMWbaezRA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-4-fa6cf253bfd44ab991c366691b68bdf5.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105863/7443" target="_top" id="2105863">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105863" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105863/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Beautiful-with-room-for-improvements"><a href="#Design-Beautiful-with-room-for-improvements" class="headerlink" title="Design: Beautiful, with room for improvements"></a><strong>Design: Beautiful, with room for improvements</strong></h2><p> It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >beautiful machine <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from top to bottom. Before even turning it on, the design of the computer a striking, aluminum-clad body that’s still subtle enough that it will blend in with nearly any office or home environment.</p><p> The tapered design makes the edges appear almost non-existent while its bulkier behind manages to round things out in a proportional manner. At its thinnest point — the edges — the iMac measures in at just 0.2 inches. On its integrated stand, the iMac measures in at 17.7 inches tall, 20.8 inches wide, and 6.9 inches deep. Amazingly, all of that weighs in at just 12.5 pounds, not including the keyboard and mouse.</p><p> Overall, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac is a solid all-in-one computer that packs a lot of power into a tiny, well-designed package.</p><p> Aside from the Apple logo on the front aluminum chin of the iMac, all of the connections and ports on the iMac are on the rear of the computer. This includes, left to right: a 3.5mm headphone jack, SD card slot, four USB 3.0 ports, two Thunderbolt 3.0 ports (USB-C), a Gigabit Ethernet port, and power adapter. There’s also a Kensington lock slot to let you secure the the iMac.</p><p> We would’ve liked to see a thinner bezel around the screen, as the one present on the iMac is about half an inch — much larger than even the most basic PC monitors. It’d be a bit different if Apple were doing more with that real estate, but as it stands, it feels like wasted space</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gM_JxuZjDbSUs7DYtXIwUIqqz0Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-3-d30c5f8414e94cbd9b1ec8aea9b18950.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557742/17382" target="_top" id="1557742">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557742" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557742/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-One-plug-and-you’re-good-to-go"><a href="#Setup-Process-One-plug-and-you’re-good-to-go" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: One plug and you’re good to go"></a><strong>Setup Process: One plug and you’re good to go</strong></h2><p> One of Apple’s core tenets is simplicity, and the 4K iMac is no exception to this rule. Inside the box is the computer itself and a box which contains the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. Additional components include the power connection for the computer, a Lightning cable for charging the mouse and keyboard, and a small package of documentation.</p><p> Setting up the iMac is as simple as unwrapping it from its protective cover, setting it on the desk, plugging it in with the included power cord, and pressing the power button. As it boots up, we turned on the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. By the time the iMac was to the setup screen — a process that took approximately 60 seconds — the two were already paired with the computer and ready to be used.</p><p> Going through the setup process took us approximately five minutes, which included setting up our iCloud account and getting the various login settings in place. We opted to set this up as a new computer, but there’s also the ability to set it up from an Apple Time Capsule backup or transfer content from a PC via USB. The amount of time those options take will vary depending on the device you’re transferring the information from as well as the amount of data being transferred.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/1062450/7443" target="_top" id="1062450">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-1062450" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/1062450/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Bright-brilliant-and-ready-to-shine"><a href="#Display-Bright-brilliant-and-ready-to-shine" class="headerlink" title="Display: Bright, brilliant, and ready to shine"></a><strong>Display: Bright, brilliant, and ready to shine</strong></h2><p> With a resolution of 4096 x 2304 pixels, the 4K iMac has more than 9.4 million pixels and features a pixel density of 217 pixels per inch, more than enough to make individual pixels indistinguishable at normal viewing distances. Text was clear across nearly every application and browser and photos just came to life with ridiculous levels of detail.</p><p> The brightness, contrast, and clarity of the screen are stunning.

Unlike a traditional hard drive (HDD), which relies exclusively on spinning platters to write and read information, Apple’s Fusion Drive also adds a small solid state storage (SSD) partition. This is where the operating system and most critical applications are stored, as solid state memory is much faster than traditional HDDs. The result is a drive that offers some of the advantages of SSDs while still offering the more affordable price tag and capacity of HDDs.</p><p> In our tests, boot-up time ranged from 15 seconds to 25 seconds. Considering the hybrid-style Fusion Drive, this lines up with our expectations, falling right between SSD speeds and HDD speeds. The same held true with boot-up times for various applications, ranging from Safari to more resource-intensive applications such as Final Cut Pro.</p><p> Moving onto the CPU and GPU benchmarks, we tested the iMac with both Geekbench and Cinebench to see how well the 3.4GHz quad-core processor and AMD Radeon Pro 560 held up.</p><p> “Could you build a PC with better specs for far less money? Absolutely. But it won’t be running macOS and it certainly won’t be as slim and streamlined as the iMac.”</p><p> In the Geekbench tests, the iMac scored 4,866 on the single core test, 14,151 on the multi-core test, and 56,974 on the OpenCL score. This falls in line with other iMacs of the same specifications and hovers around other computers with similar specifications. In Cinebench, the iMac achieved 93.86 frames per second in the OpenGL test and a score of 584 cb in the CPU test.</p><p> All-in-all, the iMac seems to punch right at or above its specifications when compared to similar hardware. It’s not going to be pumping out 8K footage, but for basic 4K video editing and image post-processing, the graphics card is more than enough. As for productivity, there’s not much you can throw at the iMac that it can’t handle. The only thing we noticed slowing down the computer was the 8GB of RAM when we had over a dozen applications open, but that can be fixed by upgrading to the 16GB or 32GB model (although it’s not a cheap upgrade).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135368/19272" target="_top" id="2135368">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135368" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135368/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Fast-and-reliable"><a href="#Network-Fast-and-reliable" class="headerlink" title="Network: Fast and reliable"></a><strong>Network: Fast and reliable</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac features both wired and wireless connectivity for internet access. As previously mentioned, the iMac features a Gigabit Ethernet (RJ-45) port on the rear of the computer for a hardwired internet connection. For Wi-Fi, the iMac uses an 802.11ac network adapter with support for IEEE 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n.</p><p> In our hardwired tests, the iMac maxed out our Gigabit fiber optic internet no problem, with steady download and upload speeds. Wireless connectivity was equally impressive, regardless of whether the iMac was in the same room as the router or a few rooms over. We didn’t notice any drops throughout our tests and both uploading and downloading content was consistent.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977032">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977032">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977032%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977032/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Decent-built-in-option-for-basic-tasks"><a href="#Camera-Decent-built-in-option-for-basic-tasks" class="headerlink" title="Camera: Decent built-in option for basic tasks"></a><strong>Camera: Decent built-in option for basic tasks</strong></h2><p> The only camera on the 4K iMac is the integrated webcam, which sits dead center above the display.

If you’re used to macOS as a whole, you’ll feel right at home as we did. Compared to past versions of macOS, Mojave improves in a number of areas, including an integrated Dark mode that turns much of the user interface dark grey to spare your eyes. There’s also a feature called “Stacks” that intelligently combines files of the same type on your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >desktop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Improved<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-screenshot-1701742" >screenshot functionality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> also makes snapping your screen easier.</p><p> One of the stand-out benefits of macOS is that you’ll never have to worry about paid upgrades. Apple annually announces and subsequently releases a new operating system, free of charge, to install on Apple computers. In-between major releases Apple will also push out incremental updates, at least two of which we installed during our review process. These incremental installs can be done either manually within the System Preferences applications or be set to install themselves automatically when the computer is plugged in and powered on.</p><p> Unlike Windows, macOS doesn’t come with any bloatware either. There’s a number of pre-installed apps developed by Apple, including four new ones borrowed from Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS, but most of the pre-installed apps are the standard array of programs you’d expect to see on any modern computer.</p><h2 id="Price-The-Apple-tax-is-real"><a href="#Price-The-Apple-tax-is-real" class="headerlink" title="Price: The Apple tax is real"></a><strong>Price: The Apple tax is real</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac we tested with the aforementioned specifications retails for $1,499. Compared to other Windows PCs with similar specifications, the iMac is without pricey for the specs it offers. However, this is par for the course with Apple, so much so that the term “Apple tax” has become a commonly-used phrase. What you’re paying for is the entire package, wrapped up in one of the best-looking frames out there.</p><p> Could you build a PC with better specs for far less money? Absolutely. But it won’t be running macOS and it certainly won’t be as slim and streamlined as the iMac. If you’re invested in the Apple ecosystem and don’t need to shell out for the more expensive 27-inch 5K iMac, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac is priced much more reasonably and still has plenty to offer.</p><h2 id="Competition-A-unique-option-in-a-small-market"><a href="#Competition-A-unique-option-in-a-small-market" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A unique option in a small market"></a><strong>Competition: A unique option in a small market</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac has a few competitors in its specification range, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ll focus on two: the Lenovo IdeaCentre AIO 700 and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.asus.com/displays-desktops/all-in-one-pcs/zen-aio/" >Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> All three all-in-one desktops feature 4K displays (or at least the option to order them with 4K displays). Aside from that, the specifications also line up similarly, with i7 CPU configurations, dedicated GPU options, SSD variations, and beefy memory choices.</p><p> Of course, the biggest difference between the three desktops is that the 21.5-inch 4K iMac runs macOS while the other two run Windows 10. Using Apple’s included Boot Camp program, it’s possible to run Windows 10 (and other operating systems) on the iMac, but macOS isn’t able to be run on the other devices.</p><p> Other differences include various connections options on the back of the computers and variations in size—most notably the iMac is quite a bit smaller in dimensions across the board. That said, the larger size allows easier access to internals which makes upgrading easier on the Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 700 and Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC.</p><p> Prices vary greatly between the three desktops depending on the configuration you’re looking for, but overall, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac seems to hold its own in this price range, despite Apple’s notoriety for being a little bit on the pricier side.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Beautiful display in a thin, powerful machine.</strong></p><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac is a solid all-in-one computer that packs a lot of power into a tiny, well-designed package. It’s not going to blow anyone away on benchmarks and it’s not cheap for the internal components you’re getting, but it has a lot to offer for multimedia and productivity. That’s not to mention the sheer convenience of having everything simply work out of the box.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink"

All this to say that I’m an advocate for building your own PC, but I still believe the OMEN is a pretty good value for a lot of people.</p><p> As configured, our HP OMEN Obelisk came equipped with Intel’s 9th gen i9-9900K and Nvidia’s GTX 2080 Super, a top-tier combination that makes light work of just about any game you might throw its way. All this comes at a cost for this tiny enclosure, however, and the components get very hot under load. The i9-9900k is an absolute furnace of a CPU to begin with, and the single 120mm AIO water cooler can only do so much.</p><p> How has HP reconciled all these things, and what does it mean for potential owners? Let’s take a look at the performance, build quality, and usability of this space-conscious gaming desktop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OXMiCXvzh8P7esVvbjPoSorzoxM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-2-7b14850c2ca84af39d5fd116ab483d5d.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983545">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983545">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983545%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983545/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Nice-looks-and-small-footprint-with-many-reservations"><a href="#Design-Nice-looks-and-small-footprint-with-many-reservations" class="headerlink" title="Design : Nice looks and small footprint, with many reservations"></a><strong>Design</strong> : <strong>Nice looks and small footprint, with many reservations</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk looks good in pictures but starts to fall apart a little when examined up close. Overall, HP did a pretty decent job here, but there are plenty of areas for improvement.</p><p> The first area of concern is the chassis itself. The shell of the OMEN case is constructed mainly out of plastic, which I’m sure helping a lot to keep shipping costs down, but definitely keeps the desktop from feeling like a solid, premium piece of hardware. It also makes me concerned about how durable it will be over time. Most buyers looking to spend this much on a gaming PC want to get some good mileage out of it, so this is somewhat disconcerting.</p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk looks good in pictures but starts to fall apart a little when examined up close.</p><p> The top&#x2F;front of the case features 2x USB 3.1 ports, a microphone and headphone port, and a power button. The USB ports are slightly misaligned on the model that I received making it a bit of a chore to plug anything in. I would love to have a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the front here since more and more peripherals are moving towards USB-C. An SD card reader would also have been nice for those out there that shoot video and photos, but I realize not everyone shares the same needs.</p><p> Upgraders and tinkerers will also find a mixed bag full of things to love and things to resent. The side of the case features a simple button release, so getting inside is extremely painless. If you are planning on adding more hard drives, HP has pre-wired two<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/serial-ata-sata-2626009" >SATA cables <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and SATA power connectors for you, and a plastic tray is present in the two drive bays for easy mounting.</p><p> Upgraders and tinkerers will also find a mixed bag full of things to love and things to resent.</p><p> Beyond adding more RAM or storage, you’re going to hit a wall pretty quickly. There are no mounts for additional fans to be installed anywhere, and there isn’t room in the case for many other CPU cooling options, should you be unhappy with the thermals. The pre-installed 120mm<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cooling-pads-4149823" >AIO water cooler <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is no match for the i9-9900k, where temperatures regularly crested 90°C during heavy workloads.</p><p> The OMEN gets plenty of things right as well. The plastic design might not be my favorite, but I absolutely adore the compact form factor. To put it in perspective, my already somewhat modest mid-tower case, the NZXT H440, measures 8.6 x 20.2 x 18.9 inches (HWD). The Omen, on the other hand, measures just 6.5 x 14.06 x 17.05 inches. Side by side, it’s plainly visible how much smaller the OMEN is, and for those with limited desk space, this will make a noticeable difference.</p><p> The lighting system is also approachable and understated, giving a little bit of customizable flare without going too over the top. As you’ll see later in the software section, HP has made it very straightforward to tweak any of these settings to your satisfaction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gfeGQoUwG35q5t-JwO07Ax4jm5I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-3-f4e655ec9e684a47855e9ee7373ba4b6.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135353/19272" target="_top" id="2135353">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135353" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135353/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Great-components-for-gaming-and-productivity"><a href="#Performance-Great-components-for-gaming-and-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Performance :Great components for gaming and productivity"></a><strong>Performance</strong> :<strong>Great components for gaming and productivity</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk that I tested featured a 9th Gen Intel Core i9 9900K, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and the Nvidia GTX GeForce 2080 Super graphics card. This is a potent combination of components in a gaming PC, and I was appropriately impressed by the results.</p><p> The desktop scored an impressive 6,967 in the productivity-focused benchmarking application PCMark 10. On the gaming front, the Omen managed a score of 10,740 in 3DMark’s Time Spy. In real-world use, this means more than 60fps at 4K in many popular titles like GTA V, but less than 60fps in others like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. In other words, the Omen is mostly capable of 4K gameplay and is nearly always capable of 60+ fps in most common resolutions shy of 4K.</p><p> The Omen comes equipped with a 1TB<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-m2-833453" >NVMe SSD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and 32GB of DDR4 2666 memory. This is definitely more RAM than games alone will call for, but it’s merely an adequate amount of RAM for some creative professionals working with more demanding software like Adobe After Effects. Keep in mind though, even those that don’t normally need a lot of RAM can still benefit from having more. Among other things, it gives you the luxury of keeping all of your browser tabs and background applications running without having to start juggling applications on and off, which can be helpful from a productivity standpoint.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100542/7443" target="_top" id="2100542">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100542" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100542/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gaming-Great-for-the-most-demanding-titles"><a href="#Gaming-Great-for-the-most-demanding-titles" class="headerlink" title="Gaming :Great for the most demanding titles"></a><strong>Gaming</strong> :<strong>Great for the most demanding titles</strong></h2><p> Gaming performance is great on the HP OMEN Obelisk thanks to the Nvidia GTX GeForce 2080 Super and Intel i9-9900K combo. I tested a number of games on my 3440x1440 monitor to get a sense of performance. To put this in perspective, this resolution is roughly 60 percent of the pixels of a 4K monitor.</p><p> First up was GTA V, which I tested with everything except for MSA (anti-aliasing) and the settings in the advanced tab turned up to Very High, the maximum setting. I recorded an average of 120.6fps across the 5 passes that the benchmark runs.</p><p> Emboldened by these results, I went back and turned every last thing up to its maximum setting, including everything in the advanced tab_and_ 8x MSA. I was quickly brought back down to earth, with an average result of 46.6fps. For one last pass, I nudged the MSA down to 4x, and came up with a healthy average of 66.8fps. Maybe dreams can come true after all.</p><p> Next, I wanted to try something fairly CPU intensive, so I ran the in-game benchmark for Civilization VI. I used the default settings for the Ultra preset, which netted me an average of 145.5fps. This was certainly an easy win for the OMEN Obelisk.</p><p> Lastly, I ran the notoriously resource-heavy Deus Ex: Mankind Divided using a few different profiles. On Ultra settings, the OMEN Obelisk saw just 55.7fps on average, with a minimum of 44.6fps and a maximum of 61.6fps. Dialing things down one level to Very High, things looked only slightly rosier: 58.1fps average, 49.5fps minimum, 62.2fps maximum. Finally, turning it down one more level to High found a sweet spot: 75.8fps average, 62.8fps minimum, 96.6 FPS maximum.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Pz9tV-mhJl_Cjm8HSqEQ_VZPbVE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-5-cdbd9d78a8c14b8e8bce0113d12e9fcc.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Network-Great-speeds-but-software-that-doesn’t-do-much"><a href="#Network-Great-speeds-but-software-that-doesn’t-do-much" class="headerlink" title="Network :Great speeds, but software that doesn’t do much"></a><strong>Network</strong> :<strong>Great speeds, but software that doesn’t do much</strong></h2><p> The HP Omen Obelisk has gigabit LAN and a Wi-Fi 5 (2x2) networking, the latter supporting a maximum speed of 866 Mbps. Everything functioned smoothly from a networking standpoint during my tests.</p><p> I made a point to try out the Network Booster software found in the OMEN Command Center and didn’t see anything tremendously useful, unfortunately. I tried setting the priority of Steam to “Low” and downloading a game, but the game still downloaded at my maximum internet speed. I took it one step further and toggled the “Block” option for Steam, and tried to resume the download, but Steam kept on downloading at the maximum speed. The software was successful in blocking Chrome when that option was switched on, however.</p><h2 id="Software-Just-enough-options"><a href="#Software-Just-enough-options" class="headerlink" title="Software: Just enough options"></a><strong>Software: Just enough options</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk comes with the OMEN Command Center, which is used to manage your desktop as well as any other OMEN products such as headsets, keyboards, and mice. From here, you have the option to click on your desktop and start managing your PC or choose from one of the various other options such as rewards, coaching, remote play, and My Games (a game launcher).</p><p> Select OMEN DESKTOP and you can access system vitals like GPU utilization, CPU utilization, memory utilization, and CPU&#x2F;GPU temperatures. This is also where you can access the lighting profiles, overclocking options, and a “network booster” that lets you prioritize application bandwidth usage.</p><p> The lighting is executed fairly well on the HP OMEN Obelisk. There are only two lighting zones: one for the interior of the case, and one for the logo on the front exterior. Through the OMEN Command Center, you can set and customize lighting profiles for each zone. You can choose a static color, but also may choose from animation profiles that cycle between preset or user-defined colors. Luckily you can also choose the brightness, if you want to tone down the lighting a bit, and choose a separate profile for when the desktop is asleep.</p><p> The option to overclock your system has you first run a nondescript benchmark, which produces a score with no reference point (to establish a baseline). While it’s nice to have the option, this really,<em>sincerely</em> isn’t a system you want to be overclocking. The i9-9900K CPU already runs alarmingly hot, even with its pre-installed water cooling solution. There also isn’t enough room for anything beyond a 120mm AIO watercooler, and not nearly enough clearance for a popular air heatsink like the Noctua NH-D15.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151860/7443" target="_top" id="2151860">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151860" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151860/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Highly-competitive"><a href="#Price-Highly-competitive" class="headerlink" title="Price: Highly competitive"></a><strong>Price: Highly competitive</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk with the same specs as this one can be found for around $2,000, at least when it’s in stock. Despite a lot of flaws that I can point to a nit-pick about, the price is one of the main reasons I still consider the OMEN to be a solid deal. I went through the trouble of parting out a similar build on PCPartPicker, going as far as to cut corners where I usually wouldn’t, and still arrived at just under $1800 before tax.</p><p> As far as I’m concerned, $200 is a perfectly reasonable premium to pay for a system that is already assembled and shipped to your door.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J3cZUfrEy-ALtFpRbDRhw7FZI8M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-4-f78d504d7bd348eca19b7e65b4d10289.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136625/26400" target="_top" id="2136625">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136625" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136625/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="HP-OMEN-Obelisk-vs-Corsair-One-Pro"><a href="#HP-OMEN-Obelisk-vs-Corsair-One-Pro" class="headerlink" title="HP OMEN Obelisk vs Corsair One Pro"></a><strong>HP OMEN Obelisk vs Corsair One Pro</strong></h2><p> If you want something even smaller, and even more monolithic, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/corsair-one-pro-review-5072820" >Corsair One Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Systems/CORSAIR-ONE/CORSAIR-ONE-PRO-i180-Compact-Workstation-Grade-PC/p/CS-9040001-NA" >Corsair <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) manages to pack a high-end gaming rig in a minuscule 12-liter case, making even the HP OMEN seem large by comparison. It has a very solid construction and manages to fit water cooling for both the CPU and GPU inside its small frame.</p><p> The Corsair One will of course be less customizable and harder to work in, and caps out at 32GB of RAM as opposed to the OMEN’s 64GB. The main differentiation however is the price—the Corsair One in a similar configuration to the OMEN will cost at least $900 more. Nonetheless, for those that really don’t plan to do any tweaking whatsoever, that value space above all else, might still consider the Corsair One.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>High performance and fantastic value, but upsetting thermals.</strong></p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk delivers fantastic value for gamers shopping for a high-performance, pre-built PC. HP has come a long way, and now offers a much more compelling solution that will appeal to a much broader set of buyers. That said, there is work to be done still, as the case suffers from poor airflow, poor thermals, and not a lot of meaningful ways to improve them.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Omen Obelisk</li><li>Product Brand  HP</li><li>SKU  B07WQ68VR8</li><li>Price  $1,999.00</li><li>Release Date  August 2019</li><li>Weight  29 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  20.4 x 19.4 x 11.8 in.</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i9-9900K</li><li>Cooling  120mm AIO liquid cooling</li><li>Graphics  Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super</li><li>Memory  32GB RAM (expandable to 64GB)</li><li>Storage  1TB M.2 NVMe</li><li>Ports  7x USB 3.0, 1 headphone, 1x USB-C, 1x HDMI, 3x Display Port, 1x USB-C (display)</li><li>Power Supply  750W</li><li>Network  Wi-Fi 5 (2x2), Gigabit Ethernet, Bluetooth 4.2</li><li>Warranty  1 year limited</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-the-best-steadicam-options-for-high-end-dslr-video-production/"><u>[Updated] The Best Steadicam Options for High-End DSLR Video Production</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-masterclass-the-different-faces-of-hand-tracker/"><u>2024 Approved Masterclass The Different Faces of Hand Tracker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/canon-powershot-sx720-hs-review-a-compact-superzoom-at-heart/"><u>Canon PowerShot SX720 HS Review: A Compact Superzoom at Heart</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-amazon-fire-hd-10-kids-editions-analysis-top-rated-kid-friendly-features-and-security/"><u>Comprehensive Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Editions Analysis -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator made a good showing when we tested it. It gets high marks for accuracy, portability, and convenience, but it does fall down in some areas such as storing the air hose and power cable. Nevertheless, it’s a handy, nifty device that delivers the air you need when you need it.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983545">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983545">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983545%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983545/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Maximum-portability-but-not-maximum-flexibility"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Maximum-portability-but-not-maximum-flexibility" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Maximum portability, but not maximum flexibility"></a><strong>Design and Features: Maximum portability, but not maximum flexibility</strong></h2><p> The form factor of the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is a case study in maximum portability. It weighs a mere 5 pounds, and the sturdy handle makes it easy to pick up and move around. Moreover, at 11.8 inches long, 4.3 inches wide and 6.7 inches tall, it’s quite compact. And it’s hard plastic casing means it can withstand some punishment and still deliver top performance.</p><p> Unlike other portable air compressors that draw their power from your car’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V socket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (cigarette lighter) or directly from the battery, the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator gives you the option of connecting it to a standard wall outlet. This makes it a very nice item to have in your garage or basement for the occasion where you have to fill up items such as sporting equipment, party balloons, and inflatable swimming pools.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-liquid-crystal-display-lcd-2625913" >digital LCD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is small—just 2 inches—but it gives an at-a-glance view of all the info you need to operate the pump. It’s nice, bright, and can be read both in direct sunlight and on dark nights. It displays pressure in PSI (pounds per square inch), BAR (atmospheric pressure), and kPA (kilopascal). If you’re going to use this pump mainly with American cars, you might never use units other than PSI, but it’s very convenient if you ever need to measure pressure in metric or SI (International System of Units).</p><p> The digital LCD is small—just 2 inches—but it gives an at-a-glance view of all the info you need to operate the pump.</p><p> The maximum PSI of this portable tire inflator is 90 PSI. This is more than enough to inflate your car tires, sports equipment, and anything else you need. Most car and truck tires have a recommended PSI between 30 and 32 PSI. The Kensun will get the job done, but other car air compressors we tested can reach a maximum of up to 150 PSI.</p><p> This car tire inflator only has a 21-inch air-hose. So you’ll need to place it less than two feet away from the tire you want to inflate. The 10.9-foot power cord gives you some range, but a good deal of it will be running from your dashboard and out your car window. This is about the same hose length you can expect similar products, but it pales in comparison to the Viair 88P Portable Compressor which has a 16-foot air hose.</p><p> The integrated flashlight on the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is pretty bright and illuminates the pump’s working area well. This also makes it more visible to passing cars if you happened to be filling up on the side of the road late at night.</p><p> One of the more annoying aspects of this portable air compressor is how it stores its cords while not in use. Both the air-hose and 12V adapter cord share one big compartment in the bottom of the pump. This would be fine if there was a clear way to fit them in there. When we received our test unit, we were surprised to see that it looked like the power cord was jammed in with no cable management at all.</p><p> When you do finally get it wrapped up, the pump fits nicely in its included carrying case. It’s made of gore-tex, a fairly durable material, so it can take the punishment of being stored long-term in your trunk, and it’s compact enough that it won’t take up much room.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-T-minus-one-minute"><a href="#Setup-Process-T-minus-one-minute" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: T-minus one minute"></a><strong>Setup Process: T-minus one minute</strong></h2><p> Once you’ve read the user manual, you’ll know how to use the Kensun portable tire inflator. Nevertheless, you’ll want to do some test runs before you take it on the road. During our testing phase, we timed how long it takes from getting out of the car to the pump inflating one of our tires. It took about one minute, which is good time if you’re on the side of the highway with an unexpected flat.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001446/11832" target="_top" id="1001446">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001446" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001446/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Reliable-accurate-quick-and-loud"><a href="#Performance-Reliable-accurate-quick-and-loud" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Reliable, accurate, quick and loud"></a><strong>Performance: Reliable, accurate, quick and loud</strong></h2><p> When we tested the tire inflator, we took it on a road trip that took us to the states of Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. Along the way, we stopped at rural rest areas and gas stations. In order to use them in the circumstances, they were designed for. Throughout it all, the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator never failed to work when we needed it.</p><p> We timed how long it took the air compressor to inflate back up to the recommended pressure and got an average of 1 minute, 50 seconds.</p><p> We deflated all four tires on our 2014 Kia Rio to 20 PSI—the recommended PSI for that model is 32 PSI, meaning 20 PSI was dangerously low to drive on. We timed how long it took the air compressor to inflate back up to the recommended pressure and got an average of 1 minute, 50 seconds.</p><p> This is a bit longer than the average fill time of the other models we tested like the Viair 88P Portable Compressor pump, which consistently filled our tires in under a minute.</p><p> Any portable tire inflator you use will generate a good deal of noise. Using a decibel meter, we measured how loud this compressor gets while it’s in use. The highest level we recorded was 90 decibels, but it usually hovered at about 88 decibels. That’s not loud enough to damage your hearing, but you’ll have to step away if you want to take a phone call.</p><p> The accuracy was the best of all the air compressors we tested. We compared the air pressure on the digital display with that of a plain pencil-style tire pressure gauge. We found that it was consistently accurate to within a 5 PSI range. Four times more accurate than the 2 PSI range we observed on some other inflators.</p><p> This air compressor can run for about half an hour before you have to cycle it down, and given how quickly it inflates your tires, you’re unlikely to use it that long. However, if you’re using it to inflate multiple objects or larger items, you’ll have to take a periodic break while it cools down.</p><p> This air compressor can run for about half an hour before you have to cycle it down, and given how quickly it inflates your tires, you’re unlikely to use it that long.</p><p> One of the most convenient things about this portable air pump is its auto-shutdown feature. This allows you to select the precise tire pressure you want before you start pumping. Once the tire is inflated to the desired pressure, it shuts down. This means that you don’t have to babysit the pump while it’s going, and all but guarantees that you won’t over-inflate your tires.</p><h2 id="Price-A-decent-buy-considering-its-versatility"><a href="#Price-A-decent-buy-considering-its-versatility" class="headerlink" title="Price: A decent buy considering its versatility"></a><strong>Price: A decent buy considering its versatility</strong></h2><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator has an MSRP of $80 on Amazon, which is a good price for what you get. It’s not nearly as affordable as some budget models we’ve seen, such as the Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump, which will only run you $40, but it gives you the convenience of not having to be tethered to your car to inflate something.</p><h2 id="Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator-vs-Jaco-Digital-Tire-Inflator"><a href="#Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator-vs-Jaco-Digital-Tire-Inflator" class="headerlink" title="Kensun Portable Tire Inflator vs. Jaco Digital Tire Inflator"></a><strong>Kensun Portable Tire Inflator vs. Jaco Digital Tire Inflator</strong></h2><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is similar to the Jaco Digital Tire Inflator, they have similar cord and hose lengths, and can continually run for about half an hour. But the Kensun is more than twice the size of the Jaco, so it can deliver more power to fill your tires faster. Additionally, the Jaco lacks the ability to plug into an AC socket, so you can only use it in your car.</p><p> But the Jaco does offer some benefits the Kensun doesn’t. Its built-in light is just as bright as the Kensun’s, but it also has the ability to flash hazard signals for oncoming traffic, and even put out an SOS in Morse Code in the event of real emergencies. Plus, its small form factor makes it much easier to put away and store.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jaco-smartpro-digital-tire-inflator-review-4776811" >Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A portable tire inflator that can work well in a car or at home.</strong></p><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is a great choice to keep in your truck, garage, or wherever you keep your “just-in-case” supplies. It’s a device that is as necessary for drivers as jumper cables and an emergency flashlight. You can count on it to be reliable when you need it, and fill your tires quickly and accurately. Plus, the added benefit of being able to plug it into your wall can’t be overstated. It has its foibles, but in the grand scheme of things, they’re minor inconveniences.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144272/7443" target="_top" id="2144272">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144272" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144272/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  AC&#x2F;DC Portable Air Pump Tire Inflator</li><li>Product Brand  Kensun</li><li>Price  $79.99</li><li>Release Date  July 2016</li><li>Weight  5 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  11.8 x 4.3 x 6.7 in.</li><li>Warranty  2 Years</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-an-insiders-guide-to-flawlessly-integrating-tracks-on-youtube/"><u>[New] An Insider's Guide to Flawlessly Integrating Tracks on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-olympic-ice-sprints-the-best-of-short-track-skating/"><u>[Updated] Olympic Ice Sprints The Best of Short-Track Skating</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-of-madden-19-impressive-game-elements-with-indications-of-weariness/"><u>Comprehensive Review of Madden 19: Impressive Game Elements with Indications of Weariness</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/discover-the-premier-online-education-platforms-ranked-1-10/"><u>Discover the Premier Online Education Platforms Ranked #1-10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/experience-next-gen-gaming-with-a-detailed-look-at-samsungs-qled-4k-tv-the-q60r-series-review/"><u>Experience Next-Gen Gaming with a Detailed Look at Samsung's QLED 4K TV - The Q60R Series Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/exploring-the-oneplus-8t-outstanding-velocity-marred-by-spotty-photography/"><u>Exploring the OnePlus 8T: Outstanding Velocity Marred by Spotty Photography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/harnessing-raw-potential-the-ultimate-guide-to-editing-high-quality-images-with-darktable-on-macos-and-linux-no-cost/"><u>Harnessing Raw Potential: The Ultimate Guide to Editing High-Quality Images with Darktable on macOS & Linux (No Cost)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/hassle-free-ways-to-remove-frp-lock-on-motorola-edge-40-neowithwithout-a-pc-by-drfone-android/"><u>Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock on Motorola Edge 40 Neowith/without a PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-accurate-is-chatgpt-in-delivering-health-related-guidance/"><u>How Accurate Is ChatGPT in Delivering Health-Related Guidance?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-change-fortnite-name-on-pc-easily/"><u>How to Change Fortnite Name on PC Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-space-check-out-our-in-depth-review-of-the-newly-released-amazon-echo-show-10-3rd-generation/"><u>How to Make the Most of Your Space?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Alienware as a company has changed a lot since its early days back in Miami as a boutique PC builder. Acquired in 2006 by tech giant Dell, the brand has had some ups and downs over the years since then, but they still remain a reliable option for those seeking quality<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/building-vs-buying-a-pc-832692" >prebuilt computers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> One such model Alienware has continued to build and improve upon over the years is their Aurora Desktop Gaming PC. Originally released in 2009 with the R1, the Aurora has seen<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/alienware-aurora-r7-review-4689097" >several iterations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the last decade, steadily improving internals and changing designs. The R9 is Alienware’s latest version to hit the market—each model equipped with some of the newest tech around.</p><p> If the idea of building a computer from scratch with lots of individual components, yards of wires and nerve-racking installations seems a bit too much for you, picking up a PC like this that’s ready to go right out of the box can help new users get into the world of PC gaming without the hassle (though it really isn’t too bad these days).</p><p> So how does the Aurora R9 measure up against competitors in the massive prebuilt PC space? Peruse our review here and find out for yourself before pulling the trigger on such a costly purchase.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wRBNGBQw39Gc3PVZ6i0PJB4LuWE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-08-406d659ae21641d2b9df53303e8f6d76.jpg"                      alt="Dell Alienware Aurora R9"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105860/7443" target="_top" id="2105860">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105860" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105860/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135360/19272" target="_top" id="2135360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135360/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Polarizing-sci-fi-aesthetics"><a href="#Design-Polarizing-sci-fi-aesthetics" class="headerlink" title="Design: Polarizing sci-fi aesthetics"></a><strong>Design: Polarizing sci-fi aesthetics</strong></h2><p> The best way to describe Alienware’s design for a vast majority of their products can be summed up as “polarizing.” Going all the way back to the company’s early days, their sci-fi and alien-esque aesthetics have always appealed to some, while those who prefer clean lines and minimal looks flee in the opposite direction.</p><p> The progression of the Aurora’s tower design has drastically changed between models, but the R9 continues this potentially polarizing design with its overall look. What we essentially mean here is that when it comes to the Aurora, you’ll either love or hate it.</p><p> Shaped a bit like a futuristic oblong jet engine, the R9 features a huge air intake along the front that tapers from back to front. It comes in two colors currently, including grey and white. Despite being marketed as more of a mid-tower case, the R9 is quite bulky and large thanks to this design choice. Weighing in at nearly 40 pounds (which will fluctuate depending on which hardware you select), it’s also heavy, so don’t plan on moving it around too often.</p><p> Along this front intake is a slim flat panel surrounded by the R9’s only RGB lighting (more expensive models also include an RGB “Alienware” on the right side), which changes fluidly between various tones when powered up (a nice touch for those who don’t love RGB plastered everywhere, but not enough for those who love RGB everything).</p><p> Right at the top of the panel is the iconic Alienware logo (also RGB) that cleverly doubles as the desktop’s power button. Below this is an array of handy ports, including three Type-A USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports, a single<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 3.1 Gen 1 port, a headphone&#x2F;line out and microphone&#x2F;line in. The placement of these is superb, allowing users to easily reach more than enough ports for just about anything they need to connect to their tower.</p><p> Moving along to the top and sides of the case, the R9 surprisingly doesn’t adopt the popular new trend of including a glass or plastic window pane so users can see their PC’s internals, but not everyone is on board for this look either. Instead, the top and sides are simply equipped with some intakes for airflow, while the right side has a large Alienware label near the back.</p><p> The rear of the new Aurora model isn’t the most attractive, with its bare metal construction, but this isn’t really important since you’ll likely never see it. Without listing the huge amount of ports back here (you can check the specs tab on this page for the full breakdown), the back hosts all of your connections for displays, power, speakers, USBs and more. Arranged in a vertical I&#x2F;O shield, these are all easily accessible and quite standard for a desktop PC.</p><p> If you love Alienware or the look of the R9, it’s not a bad option, but it’s certainly not the most frugal.</p><p> Inside the case, Alienware has made the new R9 quite upgradeable, allowing owners to easily pull things apart for access to various components. Though it’s a bit cramped inside, the genius ability to swing the PSU (power supply unit) out to the side when the case is removed provides easier access to the motherboard and all its parts. While we’re a bit concerned with the airflow due to this tight fit inside the case, it does allow you to upgrade hardware down the line if you want.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a><strong>Setup Process: Plug and play</strong></h2><p> Because this is a prebuilt, setting up your new PC is super simple—essentially plug and play. This is another hugely important thing to consider if you want to get into PC gaming, but don’t know the first thing about installing an OS, troubleshooting build issues or navigating the BIOS.</p><p> Once you’ve got the R9 unboxed, the first step is to plug everything in. The basic list for this includes the power cable, your display port of choice (the R9 comes with VGA,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/displayport-vs-hdmi-4686971" >DisplayPort <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> depending on your hardware), a mouse and keyboard and Ethernet if you’re not using the included Wi-Fi card.</p><p> With your tower properly plugged in to all these various parts, you can then go ahead and hit the power button to boot it up. Because these PCs come pre-equipped with Windows 10, the Aurora should only take a bit to get started during the initial boot sequence before prompting you to follow along with the on-screen instructions for setting up Windows. This portion is pretty simple, so just follow along the steps that’ll have you sign into your Microsoft account (or create one), connect to the internet, select a language and timezone, etc.</p><p> Upon landing at your new desktop within Windows 10, the rest of the setup process is mostly up to you. Typically, I continue the initial process by checking for Windows updates, installing those first and restarting as necessary, followed by downloading updates for drivers and graphics cards. Once you’ve got the important software updated, the next best thing is to download your favorite apps and software you want to use, like Steam, Spotify, Chrome, etc.</p><p> From here, you can either fine tune your new PC’s looks within the settings menu or keep things as they are. If you’re using a monitor with a higher refresh rate or resolution, it’s also a good idea to ensure your PC is fully utilizing this by perusing the display settings and options. After all, nobody likes finding out they’ve been stuck on 60Hz with their display that’s capable of hitting 144Hz.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037359/7443" target="_top" id="2037359">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037359" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037359/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Results-may-vary"><a href="#Performance-Results-may-vary" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Results may vary"></a><strong>Performance: Results may vary</strong></h2><p> Determining the overall performance of the Aurora R9 will entirely be subject to which hardware options or model you purchased. For performance, you get what you pay for. A quick note on this is that you should typically purchase the best components for your specific needs that are within your budget. If you want to primarily game, your GPU is perhaps the most important part, so start there. For those who want a balance between gaming and work performance, make sure you get a decent CPU.</p><p> So with that disclaimer out of the way, we can evaluate the performance of our specific R9 model, which happens to be the base unit at the cheapest price point. This variant is equipped with a 9th Gen Intel Core i5 9400, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650, 8GB HyperX FURY DDR4 XMP at 2666MHz and a 1TB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb&#x2F;s HDD. None of these components are considered top-of-the-line, but this is the budget build of the R9 models that’ll probably be one of the more popular options due to the price.</p><p> First up, let’s take a look at boot time. Unfortunately, this model doesn’t include an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/solid-state-drive-833448" >SSD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for the boot drive, unlike most of the pricier options. You can add one, but it costs extra. HDDs like the 7200RPM one on our version are notoriously slower compared to an SSD, so the roughly 40-second boot time for ours leaves a bit to be desired. In contrast, an SSD will normally take just 10 seconds.</p><p> This HDD is also slower for everything else. Searching through folders, opening files, loading games and anything else that involves storage access will be a bit sluggish. I may be biased coming from a PC with M.2 SSDs, but it’s something to consider when looking through options on hardware when buying a PC. If you can afford it, I highly recommend adding an SSD, even if it’s just for the OS.</p><p> The i5 9400 CPU certainly won’t blow you away, but for most lighter tasks like browsing the web, shuffling through files and doing some light editing with Adobe products, it’s perfectly capable for most average users. If you want to do lots of heavy computing, you’ll need to spend the dough on a beefier CPU.</p><p> On the whole, this hardware config is decent for light users, but probably not enough for those who want to do a lot of multitasking or intense, CPU-dependent processing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zWvKnnWGsRBdtRIHTYYD7HEs0qI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-13-88a6bd8dac13438794a0bb038df7757f.jpg"                      alt="Dell Alienware Aurora R9"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Gaming-From-ok-to-amazing-if-you-have-the-cash"><a href="#Gaming-From-ok-to-amazing-if-you-have-the-cash" class="headerlink" title="Gaming: From ok to amazing, if you have the cash"></a><strong>Gaming: From ok to amazing, if you have the cash</strong></h2><p> Much like performance in everyday tasks, your performance in gaming is based on what hardware your Aurora features. You can go all the way up to a monsterous gaming rig with a GTX 2080, or all the way down to our little base model with a GTX 1650, so it’s up to you how much performance you’re willing to pay for.</p><p> For our R9 with a modest 1650 GPU, performance will surpass entry-level gaming consoles of the time, like a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-review-4707563" >Nintendo Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , PS4 or Xbox One. However, it’s essentially capped with 1080p gaming, so keep that in mind if you want to bump up to 2K or 4K resolutions, as it’ll struggle to provide solid performance.</p><p> We tested the Aurora with a number of titles, from indie games to bigger AAA titles, each of which can vastly differ in terms of optimization. For our monitor, we used a 1080p Viewsonic display capable of hitting 144Hz to ensure this peripheral wouldn’t hold back the PC.</p><p> Now onto the tests. First up, we monitored the average frames per second (fps) on some bigger titles like Gears 5, Battlefield V and PUBGrunning the recommended settings. For hardware intensive games like these, the R9 was surprisingly capable, usually in the range of 60-70fps on average. This isn’t amazing, but it is solid and better than the performance of something like an XB1. Thanks to our monitor’s adaptive synchronization technology, we didn’t notice any big tears or stutters either.</p><p> With indie games or those less GPU-intensive, like Terraria, League of Legends and World of Warcraft, this specific R9 variant was more than capable, successfully getting over 100 FPS with ease and even maxing out the 144Hz of our monitor for some titles. If you’re not someone who demands the best graphics settings or the latest AAA titles, this Aurora is a decent option if you want to save some money.</p><p> Aside from FPS, the load times for games compared to my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-external-hard-drives-4050413" >SSD-equipped <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> PC were much, much slower. Loading into planets and zones in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >Destiny 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> takes only a few moments with an SSD, while this HDD R9 felt twice as long or more—similar to what you’d see with any current-gen gaming console (they all have HDDs).</p><p> Your gaming performance in relation to the Aurora is subject to your hardware, peripherals and network speeds if playing an online game, so choose the best model you can afford within your budgetary restrictions and keep in mind how you plan to use your PC.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139119/17108" target="_top" id="2139119">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139119" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139119/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Decent-prebuilt-performance-and-surround-sound"><a href="#Audio-Decent-prebuilt-performance-and-surround-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Decent prebuilt performance and surround sound"></a><strong>Audio: Decent prebuilt performance and surround sound</strong></h2><p> A quality audio setup is something often overlooked when it comes to computers, but it’s something that can really add to the overall enjoyment of your PC. Immersive soundscapes in games and movies, astounding dynamic range in music and crisp, clear dialogue combine to separate the mediocre computers from the great.</p><p> For the Aurora R9, the audio quality is surprisingly good, thanks to a host of included hardware and software options like internal high-definition 7.1+2 performance audio. However, this being a prebuilt coming straight from Dell, it’s a bit more difficult to determine where the included Realtek ALC3861 driver falls on the spectrum because it’s exclusive to Dell products.</p><p> Taking a close look at our entry-level R9 stacked against a similarly priced G5, it’s easy to see how the premium Alienware branding comes into play.</p><p> If you’ve got a beefy external audio setup with lots of speakers, you’re in luck, as the R9 features tons of ports for your equipment. Ports on the back include a center&#x2F;subwoofer output, rear surround output, side surround output and two coaxial S&#x2F;PDIF ports for connecting an amplifier, speakers or a TV for digital audio output through a coaxial cable.</p><p> Although true audiophiles will still want to stick with a DAC, or digital-to-analog converter, the Aurora R9 packs in pretty decent audio options for most users.</p><h2 id="Network-Solid-Ethernet-average-Wi-Fi"><a href="#Network-Solid-Ethernet-average-Wi-Fi" class="headerlink" title="Network: Solid Ethernet, average Wi-Fi"></a><strong>Network: Solid Ethernet, average Wi-Fi</strong></h2><p> In the age of the internet, network speeds and performance are paramount for most users, especially so if you’re a gamer. This fact not only applies to those who love online multiplayer games, but also those who prefer singleplayer since most people now download their software online.</p><p> Like most modern computers these days, the Aurora R9 will provide optimal network speeds while connected to a good ole Ethernet cable. Installed on our R9, and all other Aurora models, is the RJ-45 Killer E2500 Gigabit Ethernet port. With a proper Ethernet cable, this port can provide a maximum data rate up to 1,000 Mbps. Since most people around the world still lack access to any internet speeds that quick, the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-gigabit-ethernet-816338" >gigabit port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will essentially be capped at whatever your internet speed is (ours is 200 Mbps).</p><p> The R9 also features an integrated networking solution called Killer E2500 Ethernet LAN, which is found on the motherboard of all Alienware Auroras. The Killer E2500 is the newest Rivet Networks gigabit Ethernet controller that works by detecting and prioritizing your games, video and chat applications to improve latency, reduce jitter and help eliminate video freezes.</p><p> Using the included Killer Control Center software provides even more benefits to your network performance. This program allows users to control tons of various aspects for their PC’s network, so it’s a nice extra to have included in the purchase. With this software, you can see which applications are using bandwidth and how much of your bandwidth is being used. Killer Control Center will then automatically prioritize certain apps or let you decide for yourself which ones you want to have priority for optimal performance.</p><p> Wi-Fi is something that still lags far behind a hard-wired connection, and the Aurora R9 is no different in this area. Downloading games in Steam was significantly slower compared to Ethernet, but it’s suitable for browsing the web, streaming content or playing online (though subpar vs. Ethernet).</p><p> There are multiple Wi-Fi options for hardware on the R9 if you’re willing to pay extra, but the included 802.11ac 2x2 Wireless, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 worked well enough for us in a pinch. Even still, you’re better off using a cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wMnVqt6RV24C1Vfncnf2J3E0fAg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-15-fe70fca5ffd04da6abd8c0ef8f026eef-f6d5eaf9efcb461a902fc750a192dd0c.jpg"                      alt="Dell Alienware Aurora R9"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2112007/7443" target="_top" id="2112007">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2112007" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2112007/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Software-Windows-10-with-some-bloatware-and-extras"><a href="#Software-Windows-10-with-some-bloatware-and-extras" class="headerlink" title="Software: Windows 10 with some bloatware and extras"></a><strong>Software: Windows 10 with some bloatware and extras</strong></h2><p> Whether or not you love Windows 10, the somewhat infamous OS is what you’ll inevitably get from Dell when you purchase an Aurora R9. If you’re new to the system, it takes a bit of getting used to, but it’s simple enough for everyone to navigate once you get going.</p><p> Despite literally no one asking for it, there’s a considerable amount of bloatware included with Windows 10. Most of this software is simply annoying or unnecessary, but some of it can actually be useful.</p><p> The interesting bits of included software come straight from Alienware in the form of their Alienware Command Center. In a nutshell, this command center lets Aurora owners do things such as selecting auto-tuned game profiles, browse overclocking options and control RGB lights with the all-new AlienFX settings.</p><p> With thermal control, you can monitor internal temperatures and adjust fans to their ideal ranges to help remove excess heat from the system while keeping fan volume down. If you’re someone who’s into overclocking, the Alienware Command Center also has an intuitive overclocking control module for squeezing extra performance from your system. Users can create their own profiles here and activate them on the fly.</p><p> For RGB fans, the AlienFX hardware and software provides tons of potential combinations with up to 16.8 million color options. Users can take full control of the external RGB along the front and sides of the tower in addition to supported peripherals. Themes you create can also be saved and assigned to specific games, which is a pretty sweet perk.</p><h2 id="Price-Not-the-best-bang-for-your-buck"><a href="#Price-Not-the-best-bang-for-your-buck" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not the best bang for your buck"></a><strong>Price: Not the best bang for your buck</strong></h2><p> PC gaming is notoriously expensive to initially get into, but the prices of many components have continued to dwindle over the decades. Although the old adage that building your own computer from scratch is cheaper still holds true, prebuilt computers have also become much more comparable. So how does this Alienware match up?</p><p> First off, boutique builders like Alienware almost always come with a premium, so it’s no surprise that the new Aurora R9 may not be the best bang for your buck if you want to get the most for your money. Alienware is also one of the most famous brands in this sector, so this fact is especially true.</p><p> Starting at $850 for our entry level model and reaching all the way up to $5,000 and beyond for the most monstrous R9 models, the new Aurora isn’t exactly affordable, but it’s not terrible. Using PCPartPicker, we were able to build a comparable PC for roughly $700. This however does require you to assemble it yourself, but it’s not as hard as you might think.</p><p> Shaped a bit like a futuristic oblong jet engine, the R9 features a huge air intake along the front that tapers from back to front.</p><p> Another thing to keep in mind here is that the $850 price point doesn’t include much in the way of peripherals, and these can really add up. The Aurora R9 does include a shoddy Dell keyboard and mouse, but these accessories are definitely the bare minimum, and won’t provide the best experience.</p><p> Overall, the price of the R9 is ok at best, and you do get some nice software features from Alienware, but it’s still cheaper to build your own.</p><h2 id="Alienware-Aurora-R9-vs-Dell-G5-5090"><a href="#Alienware-Aurora-R9-vs-Dell-G5-5090" class="headerlink" title="Alienware Aurora R9 vs. Dell G5 5090"></a><strong>Alienware Aurora R9 vs. Dell G5 5090</strong></h2><p> Comparing two gaming PCs in a head-to-head competition is difficult due to the sheer amount of potential hardware configurations, but Dell also offers prebuilts outside the Alienware brand that are similar.</p><p> Launched around the same time in 2019, the Aurora R9 and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-g5-5090-review-4843348" >Dell’s G5 5090 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see at<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/gaming-and-games/new-dell-g5-gaming-desktop/spd/g-series-5090-desktop" >Dell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) provide two potential options if you’re looking for a prebuilt gaming rig. Taking a close look at our entry-level R9 stacked against a similarly priced G5, it’s easy to see how the premium Alienware branding comes into play.</p><p> For $850, you can get our R9 with the 9th Gen Intel Core i5 9400, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650, 8GB HyperX FURY DDR4 XMP at 2666MHz and a 1TB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb&#x2F;s HDD. But for $100 less at $750, you can move up to the second-tier G5 equipped with a 9th Gen Intel Core i5 9400, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, 8GB DDR4 at 2666MHz, 1TB 7200 RPM SATA 6Gb&#x2F;s HDD.</p><p> As you can see, the Alienware branding adds an additional $100 to the price, and even has a worse GPU. Though the 1660 Ti isn’t a huge step up, it’ll definitely add better performance across the board to your gaming experience. The argument could be made that the Aurora looks much better than the G5 (it’s not a real looker), but if you want the best setup you can get, the G5 offers more for less.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A quality prebuilt, but not the most frugal.</strong></p><p> With a distinct design that only Alienware can pull off, the Aurora R9 is a futuristic-looking prebuilt PC with a lot of good, but a bit of extra cost. If you love Alienware or the look of the R9, it’s not a bad option, but it’s certainly not the most frugal.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Aurora R9</li><li>Product Brand  Alienware</li><li>Price  $800.00</li><li>Release Date  June 2019</li><li>Weight  39.2 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  18.9 x 8.77 x 17 in.</li><li>Color  Silver</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i5 9400</li><li>GPU  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650</li><li>RAM  8GB HyperX FURY DDR4</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-incorporating-real-time-photos-into-team-conversations/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Incorporating Real-Time Photos Into Team Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-evaluating-radiant-qualities-of-hd-lighting/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Evaluating Radiant Qualities of HD Lighting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-best-youtube-video-reverser-online-plushowtos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Best YouTube Video Reverser Online [+Howtos] for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-expert-insights-optimized-video-downloading-software-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Expert Insights Optimized Video Downloading Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-learn-from-the-best-youtubes-top-green-screen-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Learn From The Best Youtube’s Top Green Screen Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-free-video-tools-working-across-systems-seamlessly/"><u>2024 Approved Free VIDEO Tools Working Across Systems Seamlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/5-best-ps2-emulators-android/"><u>5 Best PS2 Emulators Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-teach-you-to-transfer-files-from-google-pixel-7a-to-other-android-devices-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>5 Ways To Teach You To Transfer Files from Google Pixel 7a to Other Android Devices Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/behind-the-goals-a-comprehensive-look-at-fifa-19s-dominance-in-e-sports-entertainment/"><u>Behind the Goals: A Comprehensive Look at FIFA 19'S Dominance in E-Sports Entertainment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/budget-4k-uhd-tv-guide-exclusive-caixun-75-inch-android-model-assessment/"><u>Budget 4K UHD TV Guide: Exclusive Caixun 75-Inch Android Model Assessment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-gaomon-pd1560-pen-display-review-top-notch-performance/"><u>Comprehensive Gaomon PD1560 Pen Display Review: Top-Notch Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-maxoak-185wh50k-mah-power-bank-testimonial-the-all-in-one-energy-solution/"><u>Comprehensive MaxOak 185Wh/50k mAh Power Bank Testimonial - The All-in-One Energy Solution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-protect-your-vision-from-screen-glare-using-lensdirects-prescription-blue-light-blockers/"><u>Comprehensive Review: Protect Your Vision From Screen Glare Using LensDirect's Prescription Blue Light Blockers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/1722795816765-experience-the-nokia-71-superior-pixels-and-lens-combo-without-breaking-the-bank/"><u>Experience the Nokia 7.1: Superior Pixels & Lens Combo without Breaking the Bank!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-the-security-questions-of-your-apple-id-from-your-iphone-8-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Reset the Security Questions of Your Apple ID From Your iPhone 8 Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-potential-a-detailed-review-of-the-netgear-nighthawk-c7000-wireless-modem/"><u>Unveiling the Potential: A Detailed Review of the Netgear Nighthawk C7000 Wireless Modem</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/xbox-one-social-play-how-to-share-games-with-pals-effortlessly/"><u>Xbox One Social Play: How to Share Games With Pals Effortlessly</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Alienware as a company has changed a lot since its early days back in Miami as a boutique PC builder. Acquired in 2006 by tech giant Dell, the brand has had some ups and downs over the years since then, but they still remain a reliable option for those seeking quality<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/building-vs-buying-a-pc-832692" >prebuilt computers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> One such model Alienware has continued to build and improve upon over the years is their Aurora Desktop Gaming PC. Originally released in 2009 with the R1, the Aurora has seen<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/alienware-aurora-r7-review-4689097" >several iterations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the last decade, steadily improving internals and changing designs. The R9 is Alienware’s latest version to hit the market—each model equipped with some of the newest tech around.</p><p> If the idea of building a computer from scratch with lots of individual components, yards of wires and nerve-racking installations seems a bit too much for you, picking up a PC like this that’s ready to go right out of the box can help new users get into the world of PC gaming without the hassle (though it really isn’t too bad these days).</p><p> So how does the Aurora R9 measure up against competitors in the massive prebuilt PC space? Peruse our review here and find out for yourself before pulling the trigger on such a costly purchase.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wRBNGBQw39Gc3PVZ6i0PJB4LuWE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-08-406d659ae21641d2b9df53303e8f6d76.jpg"                      alt="Dell Alienware Aurora R9"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Design-Polarizing-sci-fi-aesthetics"><a href="#Design-Polarizing-sci-fi-aesthetics" class="headerlink" title="Design: Polarizing sci-fi aesthetics"></a><strong>Design: Polarizing sci-fi aesthetics</strong></h2><p> The best way to describe Alienware’s design for a vast majority of their products can be summed up as “polarizing.” Going all the way back to the company’s early days, their sci-fi and alien-esque aesthetics have always appealed to some, while those who prefer clean lines and minimal looks flee in the opposite direction.</p><p> The progression of the Aurora’s tower design has drastically changed between models, but the R9 continues this potentially polarizing design with its overall look. What we essentially mean here is that when it comes to the Aurora, you’ll either love or hate it.</p><p> Shaped a bit like a futuristic oblong jet engine, the R9 features a huge air intake along the front that tapers from back to front. It comes in two colors currently, including grey and white. Despite being marketed as more of a mid-tower case, the R9 is quite bulky and large thanks to this design choice. Weighing in at nearly 40 pounds (which will fluctuate depending on which hardware you select), it’s also heavy, so don’t plan on moving it around too often.</p><p> Along this front intake is a slim flat panel surrounded by the R9’s only RGB lighting (more expensive models also include an RGB “Alienware” on the right side), which changes fluidly between various tones when powered up (a nice touch for those who don’t love RGB plastered everywhere, but not enough for those who love RGB everything).</p><p> Right at the top of the panel is the iconic Alienware logo (also RGB) that cleverly doubles as the desktop’s power button. Below this is an array of handy ports, including three Type-A USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports, a single<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 3.1 Gen 1 port, a headphone&#x2F;line out and microphone&#x2F;line in. The placement of these is superb, allowing users to easily reach more than enough ports for just about anything they need to connect to their tower.</p><p> Moving along to the top and sides of the case, the R9 surprisingly doesn’t adopt the popular new trend of including a glass or plastic window pane so users can see their PC’s internals, but not everyone is on board for this look either. Instead, the top and sides are simply equipped with some intakes for airflow, while the right side has a large Alienware label near the back.</p><p> The rear of the new Aurora model isn’t the most attractive, with its bare metal construction, but this isn’t really important since you’ll likely never see it. Without listing the huge amount of ports back here (you can check the specs tab on this page for the full breakdown), the back hosts all of your connections for displays, power, speakers, USBs and more. Arranged in a vertical I&#x2F;O shield, these are all easily accessible and quite standard for a desktop PC.</p><p> If you love Alienware or the look of the R9, it’s not a bad option, but it’s certainly not the most frugal.</p><p> Inside the case, Alienware has made the new R9 quite upgradeable, allowing owners to easily pull things apart for access to various components. Though it’s a bit cramped inside, the genius ability to swing the PSU (power supply unit) out to the side when the case is removed provides easier access to the motherboard and all its parts. While we’re a bit concerned with the airflow due to this tight fit inside the case, it does allow you to upgrade hardware down the line if you want.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a><strong>Setup Process: Plug and play</strong></h2><p> Because this is a prebuilt, setting up your new PC is super simple—essentially plug and play. This is another hugely important thing to consider if you want to get into PC gaming, but don’t know the first thing about installing an OS, troubleshooting build issues or navigating the BIOS.</p><p> Once you’ve got the R9 unboxed, the first step is to plug everything in. The basic list for this includes the power cable, your display port of choice (the R9 comes with VGA,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/displayport-vs-hdmi-4686971" >DisplayPort <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> depending on your hardware), a mouse and keyboard and Ethernet if you’re not using the included Wi-Fi card.</p><p> With your tower properly plugged in to all these various parts, you can then go ahead and hit the power button to boot it up. Because these PCs come pre-equipped with Windows 10, the Aurora should only take a bit to get started during the initial boot sequence before prompting you to follow along with the on-screen instructions for setting up Windows. This portion is pretty simple, so just follow along the steps that’ll have you sign into your Microsoft account (or create one), connect to the internet, select a language and timezone, etc.</p><p> Upon landing at your new desktop within Windows 10, the rest of the setup process is mostly up to you. Typically, I continue the initial process by checking for Windows updates, installing those first and restarting as necessary, followed by downloading updates for drivers and graphics cards. Once you’ve got the important software updated, the next best thing is to download your favorite apps and software you want to use, like Steam, Spotify, Chrome, etc.</p><p> From here, you can either fine tune your new PC’s looks within the settings menu or keep things as they are. If you’re using a monitor with a higher refresh rate or resolution, it’s also a good idea to ensure your PC is fully utilizing this by perusing the display settings and options. After all, nobody likes finding out they’ve been stuck on 60Hz with their display that’s capable of hitting 144Hz.</p><h2 id="Performance-Results-may-vary"><a href="#Performance-Results-may-vary" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Results may vary"></a><strong>Performance: Results may vary</strong></h2><p> Determining the overall performance of the Aurora R9 will entirely be subject to which hardware options or model you purchased. For performance, you get what you pay for. A quick note on this is that you should typically purchase the best components for your specific needs that are within your budget. If you want to primarily game, your GPU is perhaps the most important part, so start there. For those who want a balance between gaming and work performance, make sure you get a decent CPU.</p><p> So with that disclaimer out of the way, we can evaluate the performance of our specific R9 model, which happens to be the base unit at the cheapest price point. This variant is equipped with a 9th Gen Intel Core i5 9400, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650, 8GB HyperX FURY DDR4 XMP at 2666MHz and a 1TB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb&#x2F;s HDD. None of these components are considered top-of-the-line, but this is the budget build of the R9 models that’ll probably be one of the more popular options due to the price.</p><p> First up, let’s take a look at boot time. Unfortunately, this model doesn’t include an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/solid-state-drive-833448" >SSD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for the boot drive, unlike most of the pricier options. You can add one, but it costs extra. HDDs like the 7200RPM one on our version are notoriously slower compared to an SSD, so the roughly 40-second boot time for ours leaves a bit to be desired. In contrast, an SSD will normally take just 10 seconds.</p><p> This HDD is also slower for everything else. Searching through folders, opening files, loading games and anything else that involves storage access will be a bit sluggish. I may be biased coming from a PC with M.2 SSDs, but it’s something to consider when looking through options on hardware when buying a PC. If you can afford it, I highly recommend adding an SSD, even if it’s just for the OS.</p><p> The i5 9400 CPU certainly won’t blow you away, but for most lighter tasks like browsing the web, shuffling through files and doing some light editing with Adobe products, it’s perfectly capable for most average users. If you want to do lots of heavy computing, you’ll need to spend the dough on a beefier CPU.</p><p> On the whole, this hardware config is decent for light users, but probably not enough for those who want to do a lot of multitasking or intense, CPU-dependent processing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zWvKnnWGsRBdtRIHTYYD7HEs0qI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-13-88a6bd8dac13438794a0bb038df7757f.jpg"                      alt="Dell Alienware Aurora R9"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983474">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983474">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983474%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983474/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gaming-From-ok-to-amazing-if-you-have-the-cash"><a href="#Gaming-From-ok-to-amazing-if-you-have-the-cash" class="headerlink" title="Gaming: From ok to amazing, if you have the cash"></a><strong>Gaming: From ok to amazing, if you have the cash</strong></h2><p> Much like performance in everyday tasks, your performance in gaming is based on what hardware your Aurora features. You can go all the way up to a monsterous gaming rig with a GTX 2080, or all the way down to our little base model with a GTX 1650, so it’s up to you how much performance you’re willing to pay for.</p><p> For our R9 with a modest 1650 GPU, performance will surpass entry-level gaming consoles of the time, like a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-review-4707563" >Nintendo Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , PS4 or Xbox One. However, it’s essentially capped with 1080p gaming, so keep that in mind if you want to bump up to 2K or 4K resolutions, as it’ll struggle to provide solid performance.</p><p> We tested the Aurora with a number of titles, from indie games to bigger AAA titles, each of which can vastly differ in terms of optimization. For our monitor, we used a 1080p Viewsonic display capable of hitting 144Hz to ensure this peripheral wouldn’t hold back the PC.</p><p> Now onto the tests. First up, we monitored the average frames per second (fps) on some bigger titles like Gears 5, Battlefield V and PUBGrunning the recommended settings. For hardware intensive games like these, the R9 was surprisingly capable, usually in the range of 60-70fps on average. This isn’t amazing, but it is solid and better than the performance of something like an XB1. Thanks to our monitor’s adaptive synchronization technology, we didn’t notice any big tears or stutters either.</p><p> With indie games or those less GPU-intensive, like Terraria, League of Legends and World of Warcraft, this specific R9 variant was more than capable, successfully getting over 100 FPS with ease and even maxing out the 144Hz of our monitor for some titles. If you’re not someone who demands the best graphics settings or the latest AAA titles, this Aurora is a decent option if you want to save some money.</p><p> Aside from FPS, the load times for games compared to my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-external-hard-drives-4050413" >SSD-equipped <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> PC were much, much slower. Loading into planets and zones in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >Destiny 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> takes only a few moments with an SSD, while this HDD R9 felt twice as long or more—similar to what you’d see with any current-gen gaming console (they all have HDDs).</p><p> Your gaming performance in relation to the Aurora is subject to your hardware, peripherals and network speeds if playing an online game, so choose the best model you can afford within your budgetary restrictions and keep in mind how you plan to use your PC.</p><h2 id="Audio-Decent-prebuilt-performance-and-surround-sound"><a href="#Audio-Decent-prebuilt-performance-and-surround-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Decent prebuilt performance and surround sound"></a><strong>Audio: Decent prebuilt performance and surround sound</strong></h2><p> A quality audio setup is something often overlooked when it comes to computers, but it’s something that can really add to the overall enjoyment of your PC. Immersive soundscapes in games and movies, astounding dynamic range in music and crisp, clear dialogue combine to separate the mediocre computers from the great.</p><p> For the Aurora R9, the audio quality is surprisingly good, thanks to a host of included hardware and software options like internal high-definition 7.1+2 performance audio. However, this being a prebuilt coming straight from Dell, it’s a bit more difficult to determine where the included Realtek ALC3861 driver falls on the spectrum because it’s exclusive to Dell products.</p><p> Taking a close look at our entry-level R9 stacked against a similarly priced G5, it’s easy to see how the premium Alienware branding comes into play.</p><p> If you’ve got a beefy external audio setup with lots of speakers, you’re in luck, as the R9 features tons of ports for your equipment. Ports on the back include a center&#x2F;subwoofer output, rear surround output, side surround output and two coaxial S&#x2F;PDIF ports for connecting an amplifier, speakers or a TV for digital audio output through a coaxial cable.</p><p> Although true audiophiles will still want to stick with a DAC, or digital-to-analog converter, the Aurora R9 packs in pretty decent audio options for most users.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134490/18498" target="_top" id="2134490">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134490" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134490/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Solid-Ethernet-average-Wi-Fi"><a href="#Network-Solid-Ethernet-average-Wi-Fi" class="headerlink" title="Network: Solid Ethernet, average Wi-Fi"></a><strong>Network: Solid Ethernet, average Wi-Fi</strong></h2><p> In the age of the internet, network speeds and performance are paramount for most users, especially so if you’re a gamer. This fact not only applies to those who love online multiplayer games, but also those who prefer singleplayer since most people now download their software online.</p><p> Like most modern computers these days, the Aurora R9 will provide optimal network speeds while connected to a good ole Ethernet cable. Installed on our R9, and all other Aurora models, is the RJ-45 Killer E2500 Gigabit Ethernet port. With a proper Ethernet cable, this port can provide a maximum data rate up to 1,000 Mbps. Since most people around the world still lack access to any internet speeds that quick, the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-gigabit-ethernet-816338" >gigabit port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will essentially be capped at whatever your internet speed is (ours is 200 Mbps).</p><p> The R9 also features an integrated networking solution called Killer E2500 Ethernet LAN, which is found on the motherboard of all Alienware Auroras. The Killer E2500 is the newest Rivet Networks gigabit Ethernet controller that works by detecting and prioritizing your games, video and chat applications to improve latency, reduce jitter and help eliminate video freezes.</p><p> Using the included Killer Control Center software provides even more benefits to your network performance. This program allows users to control tons of various aspects for their PC’s network, so it’s a nice extra to have included in the purchase. With this software, you can see which applications are using bandwidth and how much of your bandwidth is being used. Killer Control Center will then automatically prioritize certain apps or let you decide for yourself which ones you want to have priority for optimal performance.</p><p> Wi-Fi is something that still lags far behind a hard-wired connection, and the Aurora R9 is no different in this area. Downloading games in Steam was significantly slower compared to Ethernet, but it’s suitable for browsing the web, streaming content or playing online (though subpar vs. Ethernet).</p><p> There are multiple Wi-Fi options for hardware on the R9 if you’re willing to pay extra, but the included 802.11ac 2x2 Wireless, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 worked well enough for us in a pinch. Even still, you’re better off using a cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wMnVqt6RV24C1Vfncnf2J3E0fAg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-15-fe70fca5ffd04da6abd8c0ef8f026eef-f6d5eaf9efcb461a902fc750a192dd0c.jpg"                      alt="Dell Alienware Aurora R9"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134248/18498" target="_top" id="2134248">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134248" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134248/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Windows-10-with-some-bloatware-and-extras"><a href="#Software-Windows-10-with-some-bloatware-and-extras" class="headerlink" title="Software: Windows 10 with some bloatware and extras"></a><strong>Software: Windows 10 with some bloatware and extras</strong></h2><p> Whether or not you love Windows 10, the somewhat infamous OS is what you’ll inevitably get from Dell when you purchase an Aurora R9. If you’re new to the system, it takes a bit of getting used to, but it’s simple enough for everyone to navigate once you get going.</p><p> Despite literally no one asking for it, there’s a considerable amount of bloatware included with Windows 10. Most of this software is simply annoying or unnecessary, but some of it can actually be useful.</p><p> The interesting bits of included software come straight from Alienware in the form of their Alienware Command Center. In a nutshell, this command center lets Aurora owners do things such as selecting auto-tuned game profiles, browse overclocking options and control RGB lights with the all-new AlienFX settings.</p><p> With thermal control, you can monitor internal temperatures and adjust fans to their ideal ranges to help remove excess heat from the system while keeping fan volume down. If you’re someone who’s into overclocking, the Alienware Command Center also has an intuitive overclocking control module for squeezing extra performance from your system. Users can create their own profiles here and activate them on the fly.</p><p> For RGB fans, the AlienFX hardware and software provides tons of potential combinations with up to 16.8 million color options. Users can take full control of the external RGB along the front and sides of the tower in addition to supported peripherals. Themes you create can also be saved and assigned to specific games, which is a pretty sweet perk.</p><h2 id="Price-Not-the-best-bang-for-your-buck"><a href="#Price-Not-the-best-bang-for-your-buck" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not the best bang for your buck"></a><strong>Price: Not the best bang for your buck</strong></h2><p> PC gaming is notoriously expensive to initially get into, but the prices of many components have continued to dwindle over the decades. Although the old adage that building your own computer from scratch is cheaper still holds true, prebuilt computers have also become much more comparable. So how does this Alienware match up?</p><p> First off, boutique builders like Alienware almost always come with a premium, so it’s no surprise that the new Aurora R9 may not be the best bang for your buck if you want to get the most for your money. Alienware is also one of the most famous brands in this sector, so this fact is especially true.</p><p> Starting at $850 for our entry level model and reaching all the way up to $5,000 and beyond for the most monstrous R9 models, the new Aurora isn’t exactly affordable, but it’s not terrible. Using PCPartPicker, we were able to build a comparable PC for roughly $700. This however does require you to assemble it yourself, but it’s not as hard as you might think.</p><p> Shaped a bit like a futuristic oblong jet engine, the R9 features a huge air intake along the front that tapers from back to front.</p><p> Another thing to keep in mind here is that the $850 price point doesn’t include much in the way of peripherals, and these can really add up. The Aurora R9 does include a shoddy Dell keyboard and mouse, but these accessories are definitely the bare minimum, and won’t provide the best experience.</p><p> Overall, the price of the R9 is ok at best, and you do get some nice software features from Alienware, but it’s still cheaper to build your own.</p><h2 id="Alienware-Aurora-R9-vs-Dell-G5-5090"><a href="#Alienware-Aurora-R9-vs-Dell-G5-5090" class="headerlink" title="Alienware Aurora R9 vs. Dell G5 5090"></a><strong>Alienware Aurora R9 vs. Dell G5 5090</strong></h2><p> Comparing two gaming PCs in a head-to-head competition is difficult due to the sheer amount of potential hardware configurations, but Dell also offers prebuilts outside the Alienware brand that are similar.</p><p> Launched around the same time in 2019, the Aurora R9 and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-g5-5090-review-4843348" >Dell’s G5 5090 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see at<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/gaming-and-games/new-dell-g5-gaming-desktop/spd/g-series-5090-desktop" >Dell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) provide two potential options if you’re looking for a prebuilt gaming rig. Taking a close look at our entry-level R9 stacked against a similarly priced G5, it’s easy to see how the premium Alienware branding comes into play.</p><p> For $850, you can get our R9 with the 9th Gen Intel Core i5 9400, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650, 8GB HyperX FURY DDR4 XMP at 2666MHz and a 1TB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb&#x2F;s HDD. But for $100 less at $750, you can move up to the second-tier G5 equipped with a 9th Gen Intel Core i5 9400, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, 8GB DDR4 at 2666MHz, 1TB 7200 RPM SATA 6Gb&#x2F;s HDD.</p><p> As you can see, the Alienware branding adds an additional $100 to the price, and even has a worse GPU. Though the 1660 Ti isn’t a huge step up, it’ll definitely add better performance across the board to your gaming experience. The argument could be made that the Aurora looks much better than the G5 (it’s not a real looker), but if you want the best setup you can get, the G5 offers more for less.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A quality prebuilt, but not the most frugal.</strong></p><p> With a distinct design that only Alienware can pull off, the Aurora R9 is a futuristic-looking prebuilt PC with a lot of good, but a bit of extra cost. If you love Alienware or the look of the R9, it’s not a bad option, but it’s certainly not the most frugal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087409/7443" target="_top" id="2087409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087409/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Aurora R9</li><li>Product Brand  Alienware</li><li>Price  $800.00</li><li>Release Date  June 2019</li><li>Weight  39.2 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  18.9 x 8.77 x 17 in.</li><li>Color  Silver</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i5 9400</li><li>GPU  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650</li><li>RAM  8GB HyperX FURY DDR4</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-best-practices-selecting-devices-for-zoom-recording/"><u>[New] Best Practices Selecting Devices for Zoom Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/avigating-youtubes-revenue-mechanisms/"><u>[New] Navigating YouTube's Revenue Mechanisms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-the-essential-meme-template-toolkit/"><u>[Updated] The Essential Meme Template Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/1726030408861-2024vob10/"><u>「2024年向け最優秀無料VOB再生ソフトウェアベスト10！」</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/enabling-file-transfers-remedy-for-utorrent-on-windows/"><u>Enabling File Transfers: Remedy for uTorrent on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-of-the-mohu-leaf-30-tv-antenna-striking-value-and-functionality/"><u>Expert Analysis of the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna: Striking Value and Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/expert-review-fongos-canadian-voice-over-ip-offerings/"><u>Expert Review: Fongo's Canadian Voice over IP Offerings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/fire-vs-flex-choosing-the-perfect-amazon-or-samsung-tablet/"><u>Fire Vs.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Fitness trackers have come a long way over the last few years, and you can find options in a variety of shapes, sizes, styles, and price ranges. The Garmin Vivosmart 4 is priced in about the mid-range, and it offers a few cool perks in addition to the standards like calorie counting and step counting. I tested the Garmin Vivosmart 4 for a month to see how it performs compared to other similarly priced fitness trackers on the market.</p><h2 id="Design-You-can’t-remove-the-band"><a href="#Design-You-can’t-remove-the-band" class="headerlink" title="Design: You can’t remove the band"></a><strong>Design: You can’t remove the band</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart is lightweight, weighing only 16.5 grams (for the small&#x2F;medium size). It has a very slim profile, with the silicone band measuring only about a half of an inch in width. Now, this is great for style purposes, as the band looks great on the wrist. But, the slim design isn’t particularly functional, as the screen is extremely small and somewhat hard to read from a distance (especially if you have poor vision like me). The tiny screen measures a mere 0.26 inches wide by 0.70 inches tall.</p><p> The Vivosmart 4 has a unibody design, and you cannot remove the tracker portion from the band. I was somewhat disappointed to see that I couldn’t switch out the bands for other colors and styles, especially considering Garmin has such attractive band options. Unfortunately, you can only choose one—grey with rose gold trim, berry with light gold trim, azure blue with silver trim, or the band I tested, black with midnight trim. The band also comes in small&#x2F;medium or large sizes. The small&#x2F;medium size fit my wrist well, but when I had my husband try on the band, it wouldn’t fit around his wrist. Other trackers, like the Fitbit Charge 4, come with both a small and large band.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JsDCEVwOi6EK7WLcs2WJ03jOZb0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivosmart-4-Fitness-Tracker-3-ba9d18a527ae4b41a7242ffaccd1de30.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135412/19272" target="_top" id="2135412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135412/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-You’ll-forget-you’re-wearing-it"><a href="#Comfort-You’ll-forget-you’re-wearing-it" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: You’ll forget you’re wearing it"></a><strong>Comfort: You’ll forget you’re wearing it</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart 4 is one of the more comfortable fitness trackers I’ve tested. Most of the time, I’d forget I was even wearing the tracker until it vibrated. The band’s side edges are rounded off, making it feel more comfortable against the skin.</p><p> The buckle doesn’t press into the skin or cause irritation, but the sides of the silicone band do leave indents on the wrist after long periods of wear. The Vivosmart 4 is waterproof, and you can wear it in the pool, wear it while showering, and in the rain without damaging the device. You really only have to take off the Vivosmart to charge the battery.</p><h2 id="Performance-Body-battery-and-stress-monitoring"><a href="#Performance-Body-battery-and-stress-monitoring" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Body battery and stress monitoring"></a><strong>Performance: Body battery and stress monitoring</strong></h2><p> The Garmin Vivosmart 4 performs exceptionally well in some areas and mediocre in others, making it a decent device for runners or everyday users who want a device to track their general health and wellness, but a not such great device for fitness buffs who want seamless and accurate workout tracking.</p><p> The Vivosmart 4 has some cool perks, like a pulse ox sensor that can track blood oxygen saturation levels, and a body battery feature that uses a variety of data (oxygen, sleep, heart rate, etc) to determine how much energy you have available. The body battery feature is perhaps the most useful tool within this tracker, as it lets you know when you need to take it easy and when you have more energy available to spend. There’s also a stress monitoring widget you can place right on the tracker’s interface, which I also found incredibly useful. I was in the process of moving while testing the Vivosmart 4, and I could watch my stress levels rising as I went through the stresses of packing, moving, and buying and selling my homes.</p><p> The body battery feature is perhaps the most useful tool within this tracker, as it lets you know when you need to take it easy and when you have more energy available to spend.</p><p> On the downside, the Vivosmart 4’s step counter isn’t exactly accurate, although this tends to be a common problem with fitness trackers. I also saw some issues with the accuracy of the heart rate monitor, as I tested the heart rate monitor against a chest monitor, and it was off by as much as 10 beats per minute.</p><p> Workout tracking is somewhat lacking in the Vivosmart 4. It has a feature called Move IQ, which is supposed to identify periods of movement that match familiar exercise patterns like walking, running, biking, swimming, or using an elliptical machine. It then automatically starts timing the event for you. This feature is only accurate some of the time though. It detects walking pretty consistently, but it doesn’t do as good of a job at detecting swimming or biking. For strength training, it has a rep counter, but you can also turn on auto-set, and the Vivosmart 4 will attempt to automatically determine when you’re performing a repetitive motion and estimate the number of reps. These features aren’t always accurate though, and you may have to go in and edit the data afterward.</p><p> I tested the heart rate monitor against a chest monitor and it was off by as much as 10 beats per minute.</p><p> Overall, the Garmin Vivosmart 4 is capable of providing an abundance of useful data, but it requires a bit more effort on the part of the user to obtain this information. If you do things like add a custom stride length, edit any activities that didn’t track accurately, track hydration and weight goals, use the female health features, and pair the Garmin Connect app with the My Fitness Pal app, you can get a comprehensive health and fitness tracking experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Fu0WY5D4aslVxU_cls1YqWYQBeg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivosmart-4-Fitness-Tracker-2-67ea15321c9541f1b57d5528302152fe.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148634/16836" target="_top" id="2148634">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148634" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="80" height="31"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148634/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Garmin-Connect-App"><a href="#Software-Garmin-Connect-App" class="headerlink" title="Software: Garmin Connect App"></a><strong>Software: Garmin Connect App</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart 4 doesn’t have any hard buttons, but rather a monotone touchscreen that you double-tap on the bottom portion to awaken. You scroll up and down to navigate through the various functions. I’m not in love with the interface, which isn’t particularly intuitive or feature-rich. Although companion apps are important to any good fitness tracker, the Vivosmart 4 relies too heavily on its app. It doesn’t have built-in GPS either, so it’s more tethered to your phone than some other fitness trackers on the market.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-connect-course-creator-tool-1683347" >Garmin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Connect app is pretty comprehensive though. You can customize your widgets and choose up to six displayed activities. You can also enable smart notifications, which will send call and text alerts to your Vivosmart 4 or send all notifications. I made the mistake of selecting “all notifications,” and I received, well, all notifications (from my video doorbell, security camera, and shopping apps). I quickly changed the setting to receive notifications for calls and texts only.</p><p> The Garmin Connect app allows you to dive as deep into your fitness tracking as you want. If you’re a runner, it can track everything from your cadence to your max pace. It provides charts and graphs of your long term activity level, heart rate, stress, body battery, and more. You can also use insights to compare that data with the averages in your age and gender category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XmHmMYvuaOGE3gAGIsa_vChmpas=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivosmart-4-Fitness-Tracker-4-22ab906932be467bb2e3309e30555ab4.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Battery-May-last-a-full-seven-days"><a href="#Battery-May-last-a-full-seven-days" class="headerlink" title="Battery: May last a full seven days"></a><strong>Battery: May last a full seven days</strong></h2><p> The battery is supposed to last for up to seven days, but the battery life depends largely on the features you use and how frequently you use the tracker. If you’re only passively tracking a few metrics, your battery might last a full week. If you’re constantly checking your heart rate, pulse ox, stress levels, sleep, and counting reps several times a day, your battery will not last that long. I got three and a half days of battery life when taking full advantage of the fitness tracker’s features.</p><p> The battery charges using a clip-on charger. It took an average of 90 minutes to reach a full charge (from about 10% full).</p><h2 id="Price-Reasonable"><a href="#Price-Reasonable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart 4 retails for $130, which is slightly high for this unit. You can find a refurbished version on Amazon for around $80, which is a more reasonable price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030129/11832" target="_top" id="1030129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030129/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Garmin-Vivosmart-4-vs-Fitbit-Charge-3"><a href="#Garmin-Vivosmart-4-vs-Fitbit-Charge-3" class="headerlink" title="Garmin Vivosmart 4 vs. Fitbit Charge 3"></a><strong>Garmin Vivosmart 4 vs. Fitbit Charge 3</strong></h2><p> I found the Garmin Vivosmart 4 much more comfortable than the Fitbit Charge 3. I also like the body battery and stress monitoring features in the Vivosmart 4. On the other hand, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-charge-3-review-5072527" >Fitbit Charge 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has a more accurate heart monitor (according to testing). The Fitbit Charge 3 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FTN21JL/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5072535%7Cn5f18362fc97d487e830fd6d6cfaf2af211%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) also offers a ton of workouts in its Fitbit app, and slightly more seamless activity tracking for weight training and high-intensity workouts. If you want a day-to-day fitness tracker to track your sleep, stress, and energy levels, the Vivosmart 4 is a great option. If you want a larger screen and easy tracking for activities like weight training and cycling, you may prefer the Fitbit Charge 3.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A comfortable band with unique perks.</strong></p><p> The Garmin Vivosmart 4 is a great option for anyone who wants to track their sleep, stress, energy, and cardio, but there are better options out there for weight training.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135368/19272" target="_top" id="2135368">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135368"

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> As important a job as a jump starter does when it comes to a situation where your vehicle just won’t start, you need a solution that’s reliable yet easy to live with when you don’t need it. The Beatit BT-D11 800A Peak 18000mAh 12V Portable Car Jump Starter contains a lot of power within a small case, and along with its semi-hard case it shows promise to be a great companion to bring along in your vehicle. To see just how well it does the job of resurrecting a non-starting vehicle we drained the battery of a 2011 Hyundai Elantra down to 10V.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123729/7443" target="_top" id="2123729">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123729" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123729/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame"><a href="#Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame" class="headerlink" title="Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame"></a><strong>Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame</strong></h2><p> The Beatit Jump Starter D11’s main unit’s effectively a small black brick with red accents. Roughly the size of a small paperback book, the unit’s constructed out of durable plastic and features a flashlight at one end. Along one of the long sides there’s a small display that shows battery status, the on&#x2F;off switch, two USB power outputs, and the device’s charging port. On the opposing side a rubber flap covers the jumper cable port; a unique port that the jumper cable accessory plugs in to.</p><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case. The clamshell design has two halves that zip together to keep the case closed. One side of the case contains the unit itself within a foam insert, while the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. There’s plenty of room to keep everything involved with the jump starter within its case, and with its shape and relatively small size we found it easy to keep the case in the car.</p><p> Time and again, the Beatit D11 was able to get a car with a very depleted battery started.</p><p> The list of accessories that come with the unit includes both a wall charger and a 12V port charger, a Micro USB cable to charge devices with, and the jumper cables themselves. The jumper cable accessory is a pair of terminal clamps with relatively short cables that together join into a plastic module that plugs into the specific port on the unit. The module has a single status LED on its side that flashes different colors to signify different conditions, such as the unit being ready for jump starting, or indicating incorrect connection of the clamps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958378/18409" target="_top" id="1958378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://coinrule.sjv.io/i/5597632/1958378/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler"><a href="#Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler"></a><strong>Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler</strong></h2><p> Should you find yourself in a situation where you need to use the jump start functionality of the Beatit Jump Starter D11, you’ll find it quite easy to use. On our Elantra test vehicle we simply had to pop the hood, bring the unit over, and plug the jumper cable accessory into its port. Once in place getting a proper connection is a simple matter of attaching the red clamp to the positive battery terminal and then the black clamp to the negative terminal. With a firm connection in place we simply had to set the unit down someplace where the vibration of the engine wouldn’t make it slide and then start the car. With the unit in place the car immediately started with zero hesitation, at which point we could disconnect the unit and get back on the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> If it’s your other devices that are having some battery issues, the D11’s two USB ports can be used to charge them up. The 2.1A port provides for faster charging, and while the 1A port also works it really doesn’t provide power in a hurry and should only be used with specific devices that can’t handle the other port’s amperage. For most modern phones you’re just going to want to plug it into the 2.1A port and enjoy the faster recharge.</p><h2 id="Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs"><a href="#Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs"></a><strong>Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs</strong></h2><p> Time and again, the Beatit Jump Starter D11 was able to get a car with a very<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-batteries-are-made-to-die-534765" >depleted battery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> started. Even after repeated testing the unit’s own battery only dropped down to 85% capacity.</p><p> Charging a phone with a jump starter seems like overkill, and the unit’s ability to charge at 1,200mAh confirms that impression. At such an elevated level of charging your phone or other device will likely get its battery topped off in very little time. With 18,000mAh of capacity you can fully charge a modern phone at least twice, and still leave the unit with the juice it needs in order to start a car.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight"><a href="#Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight"></a><strong>Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight</strong></h2><p> There aren’t a ton of other features present with the Beatit Jump Starter D11 but there are some of note, including the unit’s built-in flashlight. It’s a nice addition to have if you must jump start a car in the middle of the night, but it doesn’t put out of a ton of light and the beam is pretty narrow. You can pick the unit up and use it as a large flashlight, though doing so while also trying to get the clamps attached is cumbersome.</p><p> A nice feature that is present in many jump starters but always appreciated is the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V port charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lets you charge the unit back up within the car once you have it started. Charging from the wall charger is faster overall, but people with a dodgy battery but a working alternator will appreciate being able to use the jump starter to get their car started and then charge the unit back up as they drive to their destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost"><a href="#Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost" class="headerlink" title="Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost"></a><strong>Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost</strong></h2><p> The MSRP of the Beatit Jump Starter D11 is $70 which makes it one of the most affordable jump starters on the market. Indeed, at that price, it’s the least expensive one we tested, yet no part of it feels like any corners were cut in terms of quality or performance.</p><p> At that price point, it packs a ton of value into its diminutive size.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915805/19272" target="_top" id="1915805">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915805" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915805/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-In-the-battle-of-the-smallest-this-one-reigns-supreme"><a href="#Competition-In-the-battle-of-the-smallest-this-one-reigns-supreme" class="headerlink" title="Competition: In the battle of the smallest, this one reigns supreme"></a><strong>Competition: In the battle of the smallest, this one reigns supreme</strong></h2><p><strong><em>DBPOWER 600A Peak 18000mAh Portable Car Jump Starter:</em></strong>  When it comes down to it these two units are surprisingly similar, down to the case and overall design of the unit. If you really want the ability to use your jump starter to also charge your laptop the DBPOWER is worth a look. Otherwise, save yourself around $10 and stick with the Beatit BT-D11.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dbpower-djs50-jump-starter-review-4783966" >DBPOWER Portable Car Jump Starter Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong><em>M MOOCK 1000A Peak 18000mAh Car Jump Starter:</em></strong>  This is another case of asking yourself how much you need the option to charge a laptop. The M MOOCK jump starter can but is also roughly $8 more. Its case is more of a flat square as well, so it slides more easily under seats. It’s a toss-up here, but the Beatit BT-D11 is a slightly better choice overall.</p><p> To read more reviews, check out our roundup of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-portable-jump-starters-4140286" >best portable jump starters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>For the price, it’s perfect.</strong></p><p> In a crowded field, there are few units that are as easy to recommend as the Beatit BT-D11 800A Peak 18000mAh 12V Portable Car Jump Starter. It has relatively few features when compared to some of its competitors but otherwise excels at what it’s designed to do.

Its 256GB storage space is impressive, and its read and write (data transfer) speeds reach 420Mbps and 380Mbps, respectively.</p><p> To put these speeds in perspective, imagine you had 2GB of data. At these speeds, it can transfer the files to a computer in about 40 seconds and transfer them back in about 42 seconds.</p><p> For comparison, our budget recommendation (read speed of 100Mbps and write speeds of up to 30–35Mbps) would take about two minutes and 40 seconds to transfer the files to a computer and nearly nine minutes to transfer them back.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-read-and-write-speeds-2640236" >An Explanation of Read and Write Speeds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> In addition to its generous storage space and speed, we thoroughly enjoyed its weighty and sturdy feel. Holding it in hand feels just right, with an even weight distribution throughout. An included keychain hole also helps you attach it to whatever you need (hello, backpack pocket liner!).</p><p> While the SanDisk Extreme PRO is a fantastic device, it’s important to note a few design quirks. The retractable plug is convenient feature, but it can sometimes feel stuck and isn’t as smooth as we’d like.</p><p> However, a simple adjustment in how you push the plug can quickly resolve this. Push your thumb against the retractable plug’s side rather than in the middle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VzaKxOdaMFqGHZPPFjBAiNP-s3Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_SanDisk256GBExtremePROUSB3.2SolidStateFlashDrive-3517c6beda944a6eb980e748d694c880.jpg"                      alt="SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO USB 3.2 Solid State Flash Drive."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123509/26400" target="_top" id="2123509">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123509" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123509/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> This minor inconvenience is unlikely to be a major issue unless you use it constantly.</p><p> Another feature we appreciate about the Extreme PRO is the included RescuePRO Deluxe data recovery suite, which makes it very easy to recover accidentally deleted files. Separately, SanDisk SecureAccess software keeps your information secure using 128-bit encryption.</p><p> Overall, we see the SanDisk Extreme PRO as a true jack of all trades, even compared to other higher-end options on the market.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong>  The SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO has received glowing reviews, with Wirecutter recommending it in its USB flash drive guide.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong>  Most buyers have nothing but good things to say about the SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO on Amazon.

Oh, and its 1TB storage capacity is impressive too.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> Resembling a mini flashlight, the Flash Survivor Stealth USB roars with a behemoth 1TB storage capacity. To put that into perspective, it equates to a whopping 209,000 5MB files, enough for a music library that even the most famous international DJ would need, so you’re well covered. Other storage options (128GB and 256GB) exist as well.</p><p> When it comes to usability, this Flash Survivor Stealth USB simply rocks. Hold it and enjoy a sturdy aluminum construction with center ridges for a comfortable grip.</p><p> It’s also waterproof up to 200 meters, though we were in no hurry to submerge it with valuable data inside and find out if it was true.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6spSWh77t1fzmOyoTMN9i0PhDg0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_KingstonDataTraveler70256GBUSB-CFlashDrive-06fc6657c36c4e7c80b44488c73e4b80.jpg"                      alt="Kingston DataTraveler 70 256GB USB-C Flash Drive."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> We also appreciate how the Flash Survivor Stealth USB opens. Grab the keychain loop, unscrew it counterclockwise, and pull it out, revealing the slimmer casing underneath and the USB port. To put it back, pop it in and rotate the end clockwise until it becomes tight (like a bottle cap).</p><p> If there’s one thing we’d improve about the design, it’s the keychain loop. Its integration into the design means the hole is relatively small and difficult to spot. It may also make it hard to clip onto larger key rings. However, keychain loops aren’t crucial for USB flash drives, so we’ll pardon Corsair for this minor usability issue.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> The Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth has seen stellar ratings on sites like TweakTown.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong> If you look at the Amazon reviews, most Corsair users are pretty ecstatic. Its average 4.5-star rating covers everything from the unit’s durability to its 1TB storage capacity.</p><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >Kingston DataTraveler 70 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xOv4XG2m0FAXv2xnn1MqZOuo9o8=/fit-in/1500x1368/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kingston-DataTraveler70-be3585b8673644689895fb96814e0e4c.jpg" >Kingston DataTraveler 70 USB-C flash drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >$20 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Solid storage capacity (256GB)</li><li>Moderate reading and writing speeds</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Plastic end caps can be tricky to remove with moist hands</li><li>Good, but not excellent, build quality</li><li>Not as many Amazon ratings as our other recs</li></ul><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> : The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is a budget performer, boasting an impressive 256GB storage capacity (great for the price!) and decent, though not exceptional, build quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082533/7443" target="_top" id="2082533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is one of our favorite budget USB drive options. It’s straightforward with few frills, allowing you to easily store your favorite playlist. It boasts a modest read speed of up to 100Mbps and writes speeds of up to 30–35 Mbps.</p><p> A transfer rate of up to 100Mbps means that a large 1GB file can be transferred in less than 10 seconds straight from your Kingston to your device. It performs pretty well with no lag time in opening files, unlike other comparably priced options we’ve tested that missed the mark.</p><p> The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is pretty basic in terms of design. Shaped like a traditional pen drive, it features a plastic end cap and a slight concave ridge for a sturdy grip. Be sure to have dry hands when pulling off the end cap, as it can get stuck.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6spSWh77t1fzmOyoTMN9i0PhDg0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_KingstonDataTraveler70256GBUSB-CFlashDrive-06fc6657c36c4e7c80b44488c73e4b80.jpg"                      alt="Kingston DataTraveler 70 256GB USB-C Flash Drive."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> We recommend this USB flash drive for anyone seeking a quick and affordable solution. However, if you require the highest storage capacity and fastest read and write speeds possible for a massive music library, stick with the SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO USB 3.2 Solid State Flash Drive.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Sites like Tom’s Hardware have covered the Kingston DataTraveler, highlighting its dominance over generic Amazon USB flash drives.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong> Priced at less than $20 and boasting close to 200 ratings with an average of 4.1 stars (as of this writing), Amazon review feedback is generally positive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/R0gpCBnrQFQJSKrMdtsqJ1CtoK4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/usb_drives-3e49e18e98274da79cb37d1e49fa99a2.jpg"                      alt="The SanDisk Extreme PRO, Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth, and Kingston DataTraveler 70 USB drives."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><h2 id="How-We-Test"><a href="#How-We-Test" class="headerlink" title="How We Test"></a>How We Test</h2><p> Our recommendations come from three well-known USB drive manufacturers: Kingston, Corsair, and SanDisk. Each excels in different areas.</p><p> To earn passing marks, all of our reviewed USB flash drives must shine in all of the following areas:</p><ul><li>Storage capacity</li><li>Read and write speeds</li><li>Build quality and cost</li></ul><p> Naturally, storage capacity is a matter of preference. An international music DJ may require one terabyte, while a hobbyist may be satisfied with 250GB.</p><p> We also prioritized the highest read and write speeds for our top two picks. Read speed refers to how fast the USB drive can retrieve data from a device (phone, laptop, etc.), whereas write speed refers to how quickly data can be stored.</p><p> If you rarely transfer large files, try to aim for at least 50Mbps read speeds and 20Mbps write speeds. For more regular, large file transfers, we recommend no less than 100Mbps read speeds and 50Mbps write speeds.</p><p> Don’t skimp on build quality either, with a preference toward rugged constructions like the military-grade aluminum Corsair that can withstand plenty of punishment in your bag or purse.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151892/7443" target="_top" id="2151892">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151892" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151892/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For"><a href="#What-to-Look-For" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For"></a>What to Look For</h2><p> When you’re searching for the best overall USB flash drive, it all boils down to individual preferences.</p><p> How many files are you looking to save? For example, if you only have a modest photo library (say, 20,000 5MB photos), then a 100GB USB drive will suffice. Anything more than that, and 256GB or even 1TB options could be your best bet.</p><p> If you only care about fast transfers, try to get the fastest read and write speeds available. Aim for anything over 100 Mbps for read speed and above 30Mbps for writing speed. Remember, writing speed will almost always be slower than reading speed.</p><p> Read our <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-size-usb-flash-drive-do-i-need-2640421" >USB Drive buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036472/19272" target="_top" id="2036472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036472/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Brands-We-Consider"><a href="#Brands-We-Consider" class="headerlink" title="Brands We Consider"></a>Brands We Consider</h3><ul><li>Aneew</li><li>Corsair</li><li>Kingston</li><li>SanDisk</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-flash-drives-for-music-2438381" >The Best USB Flash Drives to Store Music in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Should you buy an external hard drive or a USB flash drive?<br> Consider an external hard drive if you’re looking for a large amount of storage, faster transfer speeds, and don’t mind a large form factor and higher cost. A USB flash drive is the way to go for smaller amounts of data in the most portable size available (and even greater plug-and-play convenience).</li><li>Are USB flash drives good for backing up data long term?<br> Flash drives are some of the less reliable storage mediums and are designed (and best used) as temporary envelopes for data transfer. Traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) are the best solution for long-term backup, providing the most data stability and capacity for the price. Or, for a faster solution at a higher price tag, consider a solid disk drive (SSD).</li><li>What’s the difference between USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and USB-C flash drives?<br> The USB standard a flash drive is built around will determine its potential performance, including the maximum transfer rate. For instance, the transfer ceiling for USB 3.0 is theoretically ten times higher than 2.0. Letters following a USB designation (like USB-A, USB-B, or USB-C) indicate the physical type of connection; USB-A is the familiar rectangle most associated with the standard, while USB-C is a reversible flat oval.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-how-to-recover-hidden-shorts-thumbnails-in-videos/"><u>[New] How to Recover Hidden Shorts' Thumbnails in Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-sdr-to-hdri-pioneers-expert-tips-and-techniques/"><u>[New] SDR to HDRI Pioneers Expert Tips and Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-joyful-sign-uplogout-flowchart/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Joyful Sign-Up/Logout Flowchart</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/benchmarking-brilliance-in-depth-review-of-the-game-changing-2020-apple-mac-mini-m1/"><u>Benchmarking Brilliance: In-Depth Review of the Game-Changing 2020 Apple Mac Mini (M1)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/common-fixes-for-counter-strike-2-failure-to-start-correctly/"><u>Common Fixes for Counter-Strike 2 Failure to Start Correctly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/copyright-concern-unscheduled-video-displacement-for-2024/"><u>Copyright Concern Unscheduled Video Displacement for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/dell-inspiron-3671-desktop-analysis-the-balanced-compromise-for-your-home-or-office/"><u>Dell Inspiron 3671 Desktop Analysis: The Balanced Compromise for Your Home or Office</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/download-winxvideo-ai-app-die-perfekte-losung-fur-ihr-smartphone-oder-tablet/"><u>Download WinxVideo AI App: Die Perfekte Lösung Für Ihr Smartphone Oder Tablet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/expert-insights-on-the-amazon-kindle-paperwhite-7th-gen-a-revolutionary-device-for-book-enthusiasts/"><u>Expert Insights on the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (7Th Gen) - A Revolutionary Device for Book Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/googles-passwords-security-checklist/"><u>Google's Passwords: Security Checklist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/1722965632695-hp-envy-5660-seamless-driver-download-and-setup-tutorial/"><u>HP Envy 5660 - Seamless Driver Download & Setup Tutorial!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-i-catch-the-regional-pokemon-without-traveling-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/mastering-the-ice-with-a-detailed-look-at-nhl-19s-virtual-gameplay/"><u>Mastering the Ice with a Detailed Look at NHL 19'S Virtual Gameplay</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/navigate-the-best-game-platforms-for-gamers/"><u>Navigate the Best Game Platforms for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/navigating-the-complexities-of-facebooks-copyright-enforcement-for-2024/"><u>Navigating the Complexities of Facebook's Copyright Enforcement for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-amazon-fire-hd-10-kids-edition-excellence-in-child-security-measures-reviewed/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Edition - Excellence in Child Security Measures Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/ultimate-selection-leading-rechargeable-battery-chargers/"><u>Ultimate Selection: Leading Rechargeable Battery Chargers</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Buyers searching for a USB hub to open up the connectivity options on their desktop or laptop are likely to stumble across the AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub. This hub is part of a suite of hubs that Amazon offers under the AmazonBasics brand, ranging from four-port to 10-port options. With this particular, 7-port flavor of their hubs, you get five regular USB 3.0 ports, and two fast-charge ports, capable of supplying more power.</p><p> The AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub definitely offers a lot of bang for your buck, but we have some quality control qualms that prevent this from being an instant recommendation. If you’re on a budget and you need a lot of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you might still want to consider this option, but let’s dig into the details before you make your purchase.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wXgyw4YH3MYx3AO1YEPSdvla-IQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics_UsbHubs_3LW4142295_02-d9ec8728693e42e9b7ca7d3108d37ba6.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-A-clean-look-with-some-awkward-ports"><a href="#Design-A-clean-look-with-some-awkward-ports" class="headerlink" title="Design: A clean look, with some awkward ports"></a><strong>Design: A clean look, with some awkward ports</strong></h2><p> Measuring 5.7 x 2.6 x 1.1 inches (HWD), the AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub is not a particularly petite or compact device, but it does do itself some favors in the design department. The slanted body contains two connections on its left, one for the power and one for the USB-B port. On the back, you’ll find five standard USB 3.0 Type-A ports. The right side contains two fast-charge ports capable of supplying more than the standard power, so long as you’ve connected the hub to an outlet using the power cable. Finally, the top contains a simple blue LED, which lit up as soon as we connected the USB cable to the computer.</p><p> This design makes it a little awkward to connect your devices to it initially, but ultimately gives your desk a much cleaner look, and lets you drape your cables off the back of your desk, minimizing eyesores.</p><p> This design makes it a little awkward to connect your devices to it initially, but ultimately gives your desk a much cleaner look, and lets you drape your cables off the back of your desk, minimizing eyesores.</p><p> Plastic is used throughout the hub for its construction, including the front plate, which is designed to resemble brushed metal. This keeps the unit very light, which we’re sure is good for shipping purposes, but it also makes it feel a bit cheap and makes it easier to slide accidentally off your desk.</p><p> There were two quality control mishaps on the particular unit we tested. First, the internal ports were somewhat misaligned with the outer casing, making it difficult to plug in some devices. Second, the labels that should be printed around the ports didn’t make it onto this particular unit, despite all the product page images showing this feature. Not a huge deal, but also not a ringing endorsement for the device’s quality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-6zArDEXr2_gqDvtkeqZAbTQKiQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics_UsbHubs_3LW4142295_05-c3e5d946a7e84b6cb1b395cff1103e42.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049391/7443" target="_top" id="2049391">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049391" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049391/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-trouble-at-all"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-trouble-at-all" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: No trouble at all"></a><strong>Setup Process: No trouble at all</strong></h2><p> To begin using the AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub, remove the main hub from its packaging and connect the supplied USB (A-to-B) cable to both the hub and your computer. Then connect the power source to an outlet. That should be all you need.

This should be sufficient for most users, and worked well in our setup. An AC power adapter is included as well, and it comes with a fairly substantial power brick.</p><p> The hub provides seven USB 3.0 Gen 1 ports, offering a maximum transfer speed of 5Gbps. The two ports on the right side offer the same connectivity, but are capable of supplying more power.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ep4bZmgChjDyFofASwezrrPrDYw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics_UsbHubs_3LW4142295_04-e00baf7ec07a4762bf437cde18e2b4de.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136623/26400" target="_top" id="2136623">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136623" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136623/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136615/26400" target="_top" id="2136615">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136615" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136615/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Just-what-you’d-expect"><a href="#Performance-Just-what-you’d-expect" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Just what you’d expect"></a><strong>Performance: Just what you’d expect</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub performed as expected in our tests, providing USB 3.0 Gen 1 speeds. The five ports in the back supply the standard 0.9A of power, whereas the ports on the side, designed for fast charging, can supply up to 1.5A.

Buyers looking for a bit more might consider AUKEY’s 10-port powered hub or Amazon’s own AmazonBasics 10 Ports USB 3.0 Charging Hub Docking Station. Both these hubs offer more connections and dedicated power.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AnTpc7CmLFfbEILGIFkFiA9Ur2g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics_UsbHubs_3LW4142295_03-063f9486bd7045c18c0643276029f85e.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="AmazonBasics-7-Port-USB-3-0-Hub-vs-Aukey-USB-Hub-3-0"><a href="#AmazonBasics-7-Port-USB-3-0-Hub-vs-Aukey-USB-Hub-3-0" class="headerlink" title="AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub vs. Aukey USB Hub 3.0"></a><strong>AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub vs. Aukey USB Hub 3.0</strong></h2><p> Those looking for a more compact device, or perhaps those more concerned with appearance and build quality, might consider Aukey’s 4-port USB 3.0 hub. This hub lacks the dedicated power that Amazon’s offering has, but comes at around half the price. Additionally, AUKEY’s hub has significantly better materials and build quality than Amazon’s plasticky device.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Smartwatches bring a bounty of functionality to the table—and right to your wrist. But these devices also tend to cast a wider net that includes fitness tracking among many other tools like listening to music or responding to email. If focusing on workouts and general wellness is your priority, you may be interested in scaling back from a full-blown<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to a full-time fitness tracker like the Samsung Galaxy Fit.</p><p> This new addition to the Samsung wearable lineup carries over many of the hallmarks of smartwatches offered by the brand, but in a much slimmer profile and a more targeted and accurate focus on fitness.</p><p> We tested the Samsung Galaxy Fit on its ability to track workouts and how comfortable it is as a 24&#x2F;7 accessory.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Tf5FJJb3h1iBWaZIkx-ZF7NeOTg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-6-b9990e3655e34e2ca712150225748ab6.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148772/18498" target="_top" id="2148772">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148772" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148772/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Functional-and-slightly-elevated"><a href="#Design-Functional-and-slightly-elevated" class="headerlink" title="Design: Functional and slightly elevated"></a><strong>Design: Functional and slightly elevated</strong></h2><p> The Samsung Galaxy Fit is a fitness-oriented device, and the design reflects this. It’s clean, minimal, and straightforward. Not only is this wearable extremely lightweight at only 0.81 ounces, but it’s also quite slim, which gives it a bracelet-like appearance.</p><p> There’s only one button to interact with, and it’s located on the left side of the watch and is responsive and straightforward to use. The strap is made of durable rubber and includes plenty of notches for a close fit. While the band is more focused on ruggedness and skews more toward the typical fitness watch aesthetic, the screen gives the device a more refined appearance.</p><p> The face is long and narrow and features a crisp, full-color AMOLED 120 x 240 display. This bright display is pleasing to the eye, but the scroll interaction is somewhat awkward given the size of the screen. A very light touch is necessary, and even then, it may take some time to get used to scrolling on such a narrow surface area.</p><p> We found the quick-access menu particularly difficult to maneuver. A swipe down from the top of the screen reveals it, but swiping to the right to toggle through all the options often just closed the menu altogether.</p><p> While this watch is diminutive in size, it can withstand the wear and tear that comes with biking, swimming, and other activities. The device as a whole is rugged and heavy-duty enough to withstand 50 meters of water as well as a drop or two, according to the MIL-STD-810G durability rating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uFwssrqnoTWtrPSlF6y16TFjA5A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-2-2e9d9cba7ec342918320509e630b0f09.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Speedy-and-to-the-point"><a href="#Setup-Process-Speedy-and-to-the-point" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Speedy and to the point"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Speedy and to the point</strong></h2><p> Other than the watch itself, the only other equipment is a wireless charging dock. Charging to 100 percent is recommended at setup, and it took us about 40 minutes for the device to charge in full from about 70 percent charged out of the box.</p><p> After that, we downloaded the compatible app for the device, called Galaxy Fit. We were able to pair the device in just a few seconds. We also had to download the Samsung Health app in order to access our activity data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/E_Ki7o6LChwW9AdtjDKL2L1lHjw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-4-abd906dedc9c440188c23a5aabdfebe0.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123737/7443" target="_top" id="2123737">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123737" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123737/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027167/19272" target="_top" id="2027167">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027167" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027167/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Almost-undetectable"><a href="#Comfort-Almost-undetectable" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Almost undetectable"></a><strong>Comfort: Almost undetectable</strong></h2><p> Like the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4174640" >Samsung Galaxy Watch Active <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , this device also features a tucked-in strap. The difference is that there’s a little pin with a round head instead of the straight pin that most watch buckles have. This detail makes for an extremely close fit that verges on almost too close.</p><p> The combination of such a close fit and little surface area made it a somewhat awkward to put on and take off the device—it was easier to ask for a second pair of hands to help nudge the strap out from underneath the band than wrestle with it alone.</p><p> While the fit can be tight, it was generally undetectable for most of the day, including while sleeping. When we did notice it, it was because it felt too snug, which was often the case by the end of day. Adjusting the fit for a looser feel left gapping in the band.</p><p> While the fit can be tight, its generally undetectable for most of the day—including while sleeping.</p><p> A little more surface area on the band and additional notches could be helpful for a more middle-of-the-line fit—what felt fine in the morning often felt way too tight by the end of the day.</p><p> So while it was mostly comfortable for general wear and during exercise activities, we found that the fit suffered from being either too tight or too loose because the adjustments weren’t incremental enough. It was hard to find a just-right middle ground.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SRdpyMKwwNLE2m_Dnn2o9thnpQ8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-3-40a8d98ca4a04e7c9b5b18531df43e6f.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118320/7443" target="_top" id="2118320">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118320" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118320/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Performance-High-marks-for-accuracy"><a href="#Performance-High-marks-for-accuracy" class="headerlink" title="Performance: High marks for accuracy"></a><strong>Performance: High marks for accuracy</strong></h2><p> Since fitness tracking is really the name of the game for this device, we had high hopes that it would perform well. We weren’t disappointed by what we found. We were pleased with its ability to automatically track running, swimming, and sleep activities.</p><p> On a walk, steps logged were in line with a Garmin watch we use to track activity, and so was running. The running data was particularly impressive to see stacked up against the running-focused Garmin watch. Even without initiating a run workout, mileage, time elapsed, pace, and cadence were all within very close range. The Garmin edged out the Galaxy Fit with heart rate and cadence details throughout the run instead of just an overall summary. But all in all, the accuracy was really quite spot on.</p><p> We were pleased with its ability to automatically track running, swimming, and sleep activities.</p><p> Samsung says that swimming is automatically detected by the watch and water lock mode will initiate on its own, and we found that to be spot on when we took this watch along for laps in the pool. The results compiled in the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-health-how-it-works-4172072" >Samsung Health <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app after the workout were also surprisingly detailed. We were able to see the strokes we’d performed and our corresponding pace, our stroke rate, overall distance covered, and something called SWOLF, which is a way to measure stroke efficiency.</p><p> One downside we noticed is that the Fit did not capture mileage for cycling workouts. While it did accurately and automatically track the time elapsed, there was little detail beyond that. The only way to track miles, pace, and speed was to launch a cycling workout through the Samsung Health app.</p><p> All activity data, including information on sleep quality and patterns, is laid out clearly in the supplementary Samsung Health app, which is particularly useful for viewing a week’s worth of activity data. It’s really the only way to see beyond the most recent activity or two, which is all the watch will show you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/APk5ikkGQieSTN39gBAQ6rf6H9E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-5-5ff5a7cfa0c34594b8d74bbb224e9800.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123727/7443" target="_top" id="2123727">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123727" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123727/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Good-for-a-full-week-of-use"><a href="#Battery-Good-for-a-full-week-of-use" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Good for a full week of use"></a><strong>Battery: Good for a full week of use</strong></h2><p> Samsung says this watch is good for up to seven to eight days with regular activity and use, and up to eleven days with minimal use. We found that this watch lasted on the initial charge for a full<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitness-trackers-with-the-best-battery-life-4077272" >eight days <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lined up with the manufacturer claims. It’s hard to say how the battery life would stack up to multiple workouts in a day—we typically only did one a day over the course of a week, but our experience with the device supports the strong battery life claims.</p><p> When we did have to charge the device again, we found that process to be speedy: it took only two hours to recharge in full.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100542/7443" target="_top" id="2100542">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100542" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100542/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Dial-up-your-fitness-with-the-Samsung-Health-app"><a href="#Software-Dial-up-your-fitness-with-the-Samsung-Health-app" class="headerlink" title="Software: Dial up your fitness with the Samsung Health app"></a><strong>Software: Dial up your fitness with the Samsung Health app</strong></h2><p> Unlike other Samsung smartwatches, the Samsung Galaxy Fit is built on a FreeRTOS (real time operation software) platform. This OS relies heavily on the companion smartphone app and the Samsung Health app for a well-rounded experience.</p><p> Most of the settings for notifications and even choosing quick, pre-written responses to texts can be set up through the mobile app. You can also choose watch faces to personalize the style of your Galaxy Fit—there’s a specific screen inside the app that details all the design options and allows you to change the look whenever you want.</p><p> In addition to controlling the watch settings easily from the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Samsung Health app is the other go-to resource. Here you can view all the information captured by the activity tracker, including fitness, sleep, and even stress levels. You can also take this a step further by using the app to monitor calories, weight, and water intake.</p><h2 id="Price-Great-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Great-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Great for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Great for what you get</strong></h2><p> The Samsung Galaxy Fit retails for $99.99, which makes it a strong competitor in the fitness tracker market. Similarly-priced devices from the Fitbit brand offer an equivalent bundle of all-day activity tracking and general wellness features but lack the vibrant display of the Galaxy Fit.</p><p> There are cheaper options out there, too, like the Garmin vívofit 4, which sells for between $60 and $80. But it lacks a heart rate monitor or the smart capabilities of the Fit, like canned text-messaging responses and the ability to send calls straight to voicemail. For the activity tracking and smart device functionality, the Fit is a fair price and maybe even a bargain for some.</p><h2 id="Samsung-Galaxy-Fit-vs-Fitbit-Inspire-HR"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-Fit-vs-Fitbit-Inspire-HR" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy Fit vs. Fitbit Inspire HR"></a><strong>Samsung Galaxy Fit vs. Fitbit Inspire HR</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Inspire HR is a close competitor to the Samsung Galaxy Fit. Both are priced at just below $100 and have many of the same wellness and activity tracking features. Both are water resistant up to 50 meters, track active and resting heart rate, feature sport profiles, log sleeping activity, and integrate various types of notifications.</p><p> But the Galaxy Fit offers wireless charging and a full-color display, while the Fitbit Inspire HR comes with a charging cable and sports a grayscale<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091" >OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Samsung C27F591 is an attractive option for gamers given its curved, 27-inch screen and FreeSync compatibility. Unfortunately, there are also several areas where it falls short. I tested the Samsung C27F591 for two weeks, evaluating its design, setup process, image and sound quality, and performance, to see how it stacks up against other monitors on the market.</p><p> Check out our guide to the best budget gaming monitors you can buy today.</p><h2 id="Design-Sleek-but-a-bit-wobbly"><a href="#Design-Sleek-but-a-bit-wobbly" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek, but a bit wobbly"></a><strong>Design: Sleek, but a bit wobbly</strong></h2><p> The curved screen on the C27F591 monitor is surrounded by an extremely thin silver bezel. There’s also a thin black interior border, but it’s barely noticeable. With a screen that stretches nearly edge-to-edge, the CF591 looks elegant and refined. The back of the monitor is a gloss-white plastic finish. Although the gloss-plastic finish is somewhat cheap-looking, it’s easy to maintain. You can easily wipe the surface clean and keep the back of the monitor free of dust and fingerprints.</p><p> The power button sits in the bottom-left-hand corner on the back of the monitor, and it also doubles as the menu-control joystick, which allows you to adjust the settings on the C27F591. The joystick is incredibly intuitive and user-friendly, and it sits out of the way so you don’t have to worry too much about accidental button presses or settings changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6aF2msW3brcK_JTXW4APn-C3wGQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4163673-3-ae16d6d969574c7d87002351f6de3f19.jpg"                      alt="Samsung CF591 Curved LED Monitor"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> The monitor’s stand is somewhat unique. Although the stand takes up a decent amount of desk space it’s aesthetically pleasing, and it almost gives the monitor a floating effect. The large, circular base is about 10-inches in diameter, but the base doesn’t feel sturdy because the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-monitor-arms-4153781" >monitor’s arm <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is too thin and long. If you bump into your desk, the monitor will wobble quite a bit because the stand’s thin arm makes the monitor a bit top-heavy. You can tilt the monitor (from -2 to 20 degrees), but it doesn’t offer any height adjustment.</p><p> The ports sit on the backside of the device, and they’re positioned near the bottom of the monitor, but they’re also positioned smack dab in the center, as opposed to being offset to the left or right. The ports are located directly above where the arm of the stand connects to the monitor, and this makes it a bit difficult to conceal your wiring. There’s a hook on the stand where you can tuck your cables, but they don’t tuck away as nicely as they would if the ports were offset.</p><p> Although this monitor is relatively large, there are no mounting holes whatsoever on the back panel, so you can’t just slap on a VESA mount. To wall-mount or desk-mount the C27F591 you’d have to use an adapter kit.</p><p> With a screen that stretches nearly edge-to-edge, the CF591 looks elegant and refined.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2139322/26400" target="_top" id="2139322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2139322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2139322/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-process-Stand-plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-process-Stand-plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup process: Stand, plug, and play"></a><strong>Setup process: Stand, plug, and play</strong></h2><p> When you open the box, you’ll find the Samsung CF591 curved monitor, the stand for the monitor, the power supply and adapter, an included HDMI cable, and documentation materials. You’ll need a Phillips or flat-head screwdriver to assemble the stand, but the setup process takes less than 10 minutes.</p><p> The monitor includes an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but if you want to connect via VGA or DP you’ll need to provide your own. There’s no USB port on the monitor either. The monitor itself is plug and play—connect the power supply and a cable to your tower or laptop. To assemble the stand, you use a screwdriver to screw the bottom two screws into the neck, and then slide the stand onto the monitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/14Ly_ys32O4szMDSlyOTtWSOH4I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4163673-4-3b8660ffba364bcabb2d095854005f4c.jpg"                      alt="Samsung CF591 Curved LED Monitor"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151855/7443" target="_top" id="2151855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135373/19272" target="_top" id="2135373">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135373" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135373/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Vivid-color-good-contrast"><a href="#Image-Quality-Vivid-color-good-contrast" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Vivid color, good contrast"></a><strong>Image Quality: Vivid color, good contrast</strong></h2><p> Adding in FreeSync and a game mode doesn’t necessarily mean the peripheral is viable as a gaming monitor, but the C27F591 performs well with most PC and console titles. I noticed the slightest bit of color distortion on first-person shooters, but it was pretty mild. I also saw some ghosting with Mortal Kombat 11 and Forza Horizon 4 (that doesn’t typically occur on my Acer Predator XB1).</p><p> Overall, the monitor has a crisp and clear picture, in spite of its less than impressive max resolution of 1920 x 1080. The refresh rate of 60 Hz is fair, and the monitor’s 4-ms response time isn’t exactly head-turning. But this is a VA monitor, so I expected a slower response time. You can overclock it (up to about 72 Hz), and there are settings right within the OSD that let you adjust the response time (between standard, fast, or fastest), although cranking the setting up may be more trouble than it’s worth for most games because you may start to notice some latency. The VA panel has Freesync, so if you have a compatible (AMD) graphics card, this can help reduce the stuttering and screen tearing that can result when your graphics card is sending frames at a faster rate than your monitor can process.</p><p> The monitor has a crisp and clear picture, in spite of its less than impressive max resolution of 1920 x 1080.</p><p> The best-curved monitors have just enough curvature to enhance viewing angles, but not so much that it causes distortion. The C27F591 has a curvature of 1,800R. The curvature is subtle, yet present enough to provide those better viewing angles. With a 3000:1 contrast ratio and about 119 percent support of the RGB color gamut, the color is vibrant and the dark tones are surprisingly rich. It also has different brightness modes for viewing movies, basic use, or for enhancing contrast. There’s a game mode, which optimizes the settings for console and PC gaming, and you can also take advantage of settings like eco mode and eye saver mode.</p><h2 id="Audio-Better-than-most-monitors"><a href="#Audio-Better-than-most-monitors" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Better than most monitors"></a><strong>Audio: Better than most monitors</strong></h2><p> Samsung’s CF591 monitor has sufficient sound quality for both movies and gaming. The speakers are located on the back lower portion of the monitor, with one speaker on each side of the arm. With the dual five-watt stereo speakers built-in, the sound gets pretty loud, but it lacks fullness at louder volumes. The treble and mid-tones are distinct, but the bass is shallow. When you change the sound from the standard mode to music mode or movie mode, it enhances the bass slightly, but the bass isn’t punchy in any of the sound modes. On the plus side, speech comes through very clearly, and the speakers rival those in some of the best computer monitors in this price range. There’s also an audio jack for connecting an external speaker. You can connect a pair of headphones for gaming&#x2F;whenever you don’t want to disturb the people around you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fpQ3bucJ6PBbUNDMn9-c_NhKkp4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4163673-2-70dae79d29794b7699b1413d15361f1a.jpg"                      alt="Samsung CF591 Curved LED Monitor"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Software-Easy-splitting"><a href="#Software-Easy-splitting" class="headerlink" title="Software: Easy splitting"></a><strong>Software: Easy splitting</strong></h2><p> The incredibly clumsily named Easy Setting Box SW is downloadable screen-splitting software available for the CF591 that lets you arrange and rearrange your windows quickly and easily.

Like the Samsung C27F591, the Acer ED273 monitor has a 27-inch display, 1920 x 1080 resolution, a 4-ms response time, and 178 degree horizontal and vertical viewing angles. While the ED273 has a faster refresh rate of 75 Hz, it only has 3-watt speakers (instead of 5-watt speakers like the Samsung C27F591).

It has the same resolution, curvature, response time, and viewing angles as the CF591. It even has a similar-looking stand. However, in addition to its smaller screen size, it also has a different color scheme, and the back has mounting holes.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The Samsung CF591 is an attractive monitor with a vibrant, curved display.</strong></p><p> The monitor’s response time and refresh rates leave something to be desired, but the addition of FreeSync helps ensure a tear-free, stutter-free picture.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Many of us grab our sunglasses along with our headphones whenever we head out the door. If you’ve ever wanted to reduce the amount of gear you travel with, the Bose Frames may be your answer. At first glance, they look like your average pair of sunglasses. But they come with an extra feature: built-in speakers.</p><p> We wore the Rondo-style Bose Frames for a week and noted the fit and audio experience and how well they might serve as a replacement for headphones on the move.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Sleek-but-not-as-refined-as-you’d-expect"><a href="#Design-Sleek-but-not-as-refined-as-you’d-expect" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek, but not as refined as you’d expect"></a><strong>Design: Sleek, but not as refined as you’d expect</strong></h2><p> Bose Frames are available in two styles: Alto and Rondo. The Alto option is larger, with lenses that measure about two inches across, a distance of 0.7 inches between the lenses, and an overall length (from the lenses to the end of the arms) of 6.4 inches.</p><p> We spent time with the Rondo style, which has rounder frames and a retro feel. The Rondo option is the smaller of the two—the lenses are about two inches across, the distance between the lenses is a slightly-smaller 0.6 inches, and the length of the glasses is 6.1 inches.</p><p> For now, both come only in black, but there are options for customizing the lens color at an additional price. Each style is made of nylon and scratch- and shatter-resistant lenses that the company claims blocks up to 99% of UVA and UVB rays.</p><p> Bose Frames present a stylish solution for streamlining UV protection and audio enjoyment.</p><p> While there are refined touches, like stainless steel hinges and power&#x2F;multifunctional button, there’s a somewhat fragile feel to the frames. Though each of the arms has mini speakers strategically placed inside them, there’s no substantial weight to the sunglasses. This is a plus for comfortable wear, but we also found that the frames walked a fine line of feeling and looking a little cheap—this seemed at odds with the innovative technology at play.</p><p> Interacting with the audio functions is very straightforward since there’s only one button. We found the placement of the button, on the right arm just near the temple, to be intuitive and easy to interact with. We also appreciated the easy method of powering the glasses off. Simply removing them and tilting them down ignites a white status light that then turns off, which lets you know the glasses have been powered off. This is also something that can happen automatically as a battery-conserving measure if the frames detect five minutes of non-use.</p><p> Safely storing the sunglasses when you’re not using them is made easier by the protective case the frames come packaged with. The only downside is that the wireless charging cable won’t fit in the case with the glasses; there’s a separate pouch for storing it. You could store this pouch in the case when you’re wearing the sunglasses, but both won’t fit at the same time.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137411/7443" target="_top" id="2137411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Wearable-but-slightly-heavy"><a href="#Comfort-Wearable-but-slightly-heavy" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Wearable but slightly heavy"></a><strong>Comfort: Wearable but slightly heavy</strong></h2><p> The Bose Frames offer a fairly comfortable fit. While they’re not at all bulky or hefty in the hands, we did notice that wearing them for over an hour did start to feel heavy on the face. We experienced some discomfort particularly in the nose bridge area where the frames pressed into the skin, but this is not an uncommon fit issue with regular sunglasses or glasses.</p><p> We also wore these on a short one-mile jog and noticed a bit of slipping and sliding halfway through the run. It was a hot day, so sweat was a factor, and Bose does not attach any sweat or water-resistant capabilities to these frames so they’re not exactly an ideal pick for exercising. But these frames would likely stand up to general outdoor activities like a leisurely game of catch or casual bike riding, and anything that doesn’t involve a lot of running or intense movement.</p><p> In terms of overall lens quality, we appreciated how rugged they were. They picked up smudges, but scratching was a non-issue even when we dropped the frames on a hardwood floor and left them loose in a bag with keys.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Warm-but-not-immersive"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Warm-but-not-immersive" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Warm but not immersive"></a><strong>Sound Quality: Warm but not immersive</strong></h2><p> The Bose brand is known for its high-quality speakers and headphones, so there’s a lot on the line for these frames. Even though there is no ear tip or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-earbuds-4140480" >bone conduction <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> technology (headphones that deliver sound through the cheekbones to the inner ear), we were impressed with how crisp, warm, and close the listening experience was. We never experienced a far-away feeling or worried about disturbing others around us since only a minimal amount of sound leaks out.</p><p> We were impressed with how crisp, warm, and close the listening experience was.</p><p> The listening experience isn’t quite as comfortable when there’s a lot of background noise, though. Even modest traffic could completely drown out the audio. It was also something of a challenge to raise the volume to a comfortable degree. Even the loudest setting did not seem very loud, especially with considerable background noise. And when we compared the same volume levels to in-ear headphones, we realized the volume was actually much higher than we perceived it to be.</p><p> For those who like a booming and immersive sound, you won’t find that with these frames. But if you prefer a background-soundtrack kind of experience, the Bose Frames supply that.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Software-An-app-that-doesn’t-do-much"><a href="#Software-An-app-that-doesn’t-do-much" class="headerlink" title="Software: An app that doesn’t do much"></a><strong>Software: An app that doesn’t do much</strong></h2><p> The Bose Frames require setup through the Bose Connect app, which is available for both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-android-1616887" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ios-1994355" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> devices. It functions first and foremost as a way to pair and manage devices your connecting devices. Bose says you can establish up to eight device connections, but only one connection can be used at a time.</p><p> The app is where you can control certain settings like language, standby timers, and voice prompts. But there’s little else to do inside the Bose Connect app. The frames are compatible with other apps and services like Spotify,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-skype-3426903" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-google-maps-4799052" >Google Maps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , so that if you’re listening to music in Spotify you could control the playlist functions within the Connect app. There’s also a way to access your Apple Music playlists directly in the app, assuming you have an account.</p><p> The Bose Connect app is also the place to view current Bose AR (<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/augmented-reality-ar-definition-4155104" >augmented reality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) apps. Clicking on the AR icon in the app leads to what Bose calls the Experience Showcase, which features third-party apps built around music, audio, gaming, sports, and travel experiences.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983473">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983473.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983473">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983473.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983473%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983473/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Bose-AR-experience-needs-some-work"><a href="#Performance-Bose-AR-experience-needs-some-work" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Bose AR experience needs some work"></a><strong>Performance:</strong> <strong>Bose AR experience needs some work</strong></h2><p> The Bose AR platform is still new and emerging, and as of right now there are only three products that are enabled with the technology: Bose Frames, Bose Headphones 700, and Bose QC35 headphones II. Each of these devices have built-in sensors that pick up on head and body movements and orientation, and this information is used by the AR apps.</p><p> We paired the Bose Frames to an iPhone 6 and noticed that only nine apps were available to us. Some of them required that we create an account to access them, and then did not yield any sort of impressive results or experience. We tried to test an audio reality gaming app called KOMRAD AR, but after struggling to establish a connection with the glasses we couldn’t get past the configuration step.</p><p> There were a couple of apps that functioned fairly well. Bose Radar, developed by Bose, offers what they call an “interactive audio” experience. There are several “3D immersive” audio recordings you can download within the Radar app and enjoy by moving your head to uncover different sounds and aspects of the scene. It’s an understated experience and sort of meditative, but it does feel odd to move your head around so much to essentially play an audio track. Moments that reveal swells and nuances in the music are nice, but you may feel self-conscious about using this app in public.</p><p> We also tested a travel-related app called NAVIGuide that provides step-by-step voice directions. This worked well and saved us from having to repeatedly look at our phone for directions.</p><p> While the Bose AR functionality is a sort of hidden perk of these frames, it still feels like its very much in the early stages. It’s best to temper any high expectations at this point, but the quality of experience and offerings are likely to expand with further development.</p><h2 id="Price-Not-exorbitant-compared-to-smart-sunglasses"><a href="#Price-Not-exorbitant-compared-to-smart-sunglasses" class="headerlink" title="Price :Not exorbitant compared to smart sunglasses"></a><strong>Price</strong> :<strong>Not exorbitant compared to smart sunglasses</strong></h2><p> Both the Bose Rondo and Alto frames are priced at $199.99 MSRP. While this is a bit pricey for a regular sunglasses, these obviously have a lot of additional features. But the price would feel even fairer if the lenses were polarized or could be swapped out with prescription lenses.</p><p> If you want to pay less for much of the same functionality, the Inventiv Wireless Bluetooth Sunglasses cost about $69 and attempt to mirror the casual look and open-audio experience of the Bose Frames, though with more sound leaking and without the status and reputation of the Bose brand audio technology.</p><p> On the other end of the spectrum, the Vuzix Blade Smart Glasses retail for $999.99, but they also perform a wide array of smart functions like recording video, watching media, and snapping pictures. If you’re looking for a compromise that skews more toward stylish and less on the “smart” side of things, the Bose Frames may be the better pick.</p><h2 id="Competition-Choosing-a-fit-based-on-your-lifestyle"><a href="#Competition-Choosing-a-fit-based-on-your-lifestyle" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Choosing a fit based on your lifestyle"></a><strong>Competition: Choosing a fit based on your lifestyle</strong></h2><p> The Bose Frames don’t really qualify as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-glasses-4172796" >smart glasses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but it’s worth considering those options when deciding whether the Bose sunglasses fit the bill. There are two models that are relatively close in price and could appeal to the same shopper who wants a stylish pair of sunglasses that offer something extra.</p><p> The Vue Trendy and Classic Sunglasses, which will soon retail for $249, come with both prescription and non-prescription lens options. They’re lighter than the Bose Frames at less than an ounce and offer stereo bone-conduction speakers, sweat and water resistance, and a companion app that allows you to customize the gestures you use to control various features and track activities.</p><p> Instead of any button controls, the Vue glasses use swipe and tapping motions only. They also support wireless charging through a charging bed in the case. These may be for you if you want a pair of sunglasses that closely resemble a “normal” pair of glasses but perform many of the smart functions a smartwatch or smartphone can.</p><p> The Zungle Viper sunglasses are slightly cheaper than the Bose frames: they retail for $189.99. Unlike the Bose and Vue frames, the Viper sunglasses are definitely sportier. They feature Vibra speakers, sweat and water resistance, UV 400 polarization, and even fit well under bicycle helmets. You also have the freedom to choose from eight different colors of lenses. Even though Zungle says they’re very lightweight and snug, these frames weigh almost 1.8 ounces, which is actually quite a bit heavier than the Vue frames and just slightly heavier than the Bose Frames.</p><p> Ready to find your perfect headphones&#x2F;glasses combination?

If you like the idea of audio built in to your sunglasses and you don’t need sweat resistance or smartphone notifications, these not-quite smart sunglasses could be an ideal everyday accessory.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/bose-quietcomfort-35-ii-review-4589261" >Bose QuietComfort 35 II <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/bose-soundsport-wireless-headphones-review-4589230" >Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-review-4770549" >Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Frames Audio Sunglasses</li><li>Product Brand  Bose</li><li>MPN  832029-0010B</li><li>Price  $199.95</li><li>Weight  1.59 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  2 x 0.61 x 6.06 in.</li><li>Battery Life  Up to 3.5 hours</li><li>Wireless Range  30 feet</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;Outputs  None</li><li>Cables  Wireless charging cord</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth</li><li>Compatibility  iOS 9+, Android 5+</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-obs-vs-streamlabs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved OBS vs Streamlabs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-social-syncopation-the-rhythm-of-sharing-media-on-facebook/"><u>[New] In 2024, Social Syncopation The Rhythm of Sharing Media on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-master-recommendations-best-audio-crafting-pros-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Master Recommendations Best Audio Crafting Pros for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-to-optimize-your-instagram-posts-using-hashtags/"><u>2024 Approved Step-by-Step Guide to Optimize Your Instagram Posts Using Hashtags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamline-your-travel-narratives-top-ios-techniques-for-podcasting/"><u>2024 Approved Streamline Your Travel Narratives Top iOS Techniques for Podcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/in-2024-discover-the-most-compelling-5-iphone-friendly-podcast-services/"><u>In 2024, Discover the Most Compelling 5 iPhone-Friendly Podcast Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-free-wmv-video-cutter-tools-top-picks/"><u>New 2024 Approved Free WMV Video Cutter Tools Top Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mov-video-trimming-made-easy-top-6-free-tools/"><u>New In 2024, MOV Video Trimming Made Easy Top 6 Free Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/philips-hf3505-review-is-it-the-perfect-solution-for-your-mornings-a-deep-dive-into-its-features-and-performance/"><u>Philips HF3505 Review - Is It the Perfect Solution for Your Mornings?

No, it wasn’t the most powerful headset out there, using a two-year-old smartphone processor to power its games and experiences, but it was a capable, completely self-contained, wireless VR headset that didn’t require a PC or game console to deliver stellar immersion.</p><p> It was one of last year’s greatest new gadgets, and now Oculus has returned with a sequel. The Oculus Quest 2 is smaller and lighter, yet more powerful and with a much better screen—yet it costs $100 less than the original. How did that happen? Well, it’s not all great news, thanks to a couple of cost-cutting measures that you’ll feel and potentially see, but the end result is ultimately a better and more affordable device that serves as an ideal gateway into VR.</p><h2 id="Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made"><a href="#Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made" class="headerlink" title="Design and Comfort: Compromises were made"></a>Design and Comfort: Compromises were made</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 sticks to the familiar modern VR playbook as a module that you strap onto your face to immerse yourself within its digital worlds but features some different material and construction choices than the original. Unfortunately, the design choices largely are not upgrades compared to the original headset</p><p> Noticeably, the module itself doesn’t jut out as far from your face as before, plus it has a white plastic finish rather than the black fabric-lined exterior of the original. It also weighs less, which is a good thing for a device that hangs off of your face: it comes in at 503g compared to 571g with the original Quest.</p><p> However, the shallower depth of the module makes an impact for someone like me who must wear glasses while using the Quest 2.</p><p> Even with the included, optional glasses spacer, which adds a couple extra millimeters between the lenses and where the padded visor presses against your face, the inside felt much tighter against my glasses. It can be tricky to get the Quest 2 on without my eyelashes brushing against my lenses.</p><p> But that’s also due in part to the new fabric strap system, which is less effective than the rubber, dome-like strap from the first Quest. That previous strap did a better job of cupping the back of your head to offset the weight of the module itself and keep it comfortably strapped to your head, but these loose, adjustable fabric straps aren’t nearly as secure. It took me longer to get the headset on and in a comfortable position, and I couldn’t find the same kind of sweet spot as before.</p><p> Oculus now sells a $49 Elite Strap attachment that’s more akin to the original Quest strap, and while the Quest 2 straps are usable, I’ll probably make the upgrade and buy the better strap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JkgQv_Sk0ofSL0Sp-jKmqe84xak=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-2-a7792535288542dba45c8bc32f882be2.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Rift 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993652">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993652">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993652%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993652/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks"><a href="#Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks"></a>Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 uses the same kind of “inside-out” tracking system that relies on four cameras on the visor to track the wireless controllers or even your hands, rather than relying on external tracking sensors as some PC-based systems do. Like the original, it works amazingly well, allowing for fluid, six-degrees-of-freedom movement in games and minimizing both initial setup and the time it takes to get going each session. It also means that you can use the Oculus Quest 2_anywhere_ without the need for any kind of external hardware or accessories.</p><p> The Quest 2’s wireless, motion-sensing Oculus Touch controllers are identical in function to the original, but are a little heavier and have a larger surface with space to rest your thumb when not in use. That’s handy. Each has an analog stick and two face buttons, along with a trigger button and a grip button. Oculus also swapped out the magnetically-attached battery doors from the first Quest controllers—which would sometimes slide open when I used the original—for ones that simply click into place. That’s a win for function over form.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1aG6kdNHMuvnim8p8_i1RwH9QG8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-3-eec6cabc11db4ed9be5254aa2bc46ec1.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 "                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> But there is a potential loss for function and comfort with one other particular aspect of the headset itself: IPD adjustment. Inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is the physical distance between your eyes, and a headset must account for it to effectively deliver clear, 3D experiences. On the original Quest, a physical slider let you precisely adjust the distance to match your own face. With the Quest 2, however, there are just three settings, and you can physically shift the placement of the lenses to choose the position that is closest to your own.</p><p> If your IPD matches or is very close to one of the settings (58mm, 63mm, 68mm), then you’re all set. If not, then you may notice that the image isn’t as clear as you’d like, and it could potentially lead to headaches if you can’t find a pretty good sweet spot. In my case, my IPD is close enough to the middle setting to be OK, but it doesn’t feel as spot-on as it did on the original Quest using the slider. It might help knock down the price of the headset, but that’s a quality-of-life downgrade that will affect some people significantly more than others.</p><p> That might sound like a lot of griping, but it’s only because some of the key physical design changes on the Quest 2 feel like compromises or downgrades. But for most people, they won’t be significant impediments. And if you’re coming to the new headset without ever using the original Quest, then you should be fine—the new straps are usable, but they aren’t as effective or effortlessly adjustable as before. Luckily, the Quest 2 makes significant strides elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gwWuuSfTzWNDoS45b-iG9qG32-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-4-27f169e7e71b4372a38e13332b7b1364.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880960/19272" target="_top" id="1880960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook"></a>Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook</h2><p> You should charge the Oculus Quest 2 out of the box, as the modest total battery life means a partially-charged headset isn’t going to last very long. You will need a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , either Android or iPhone, and the free Oculus app to complete setup, as well. Once the headset has a good charge, begin setup from the mobile app and then follow the guided directions, which will involve putting on, adjusting, and getting familiar with the headset itself.</p><p> Part of the setup process, and the process each time you use the headset, is to designate your play space by “drawing” a barrier within the augmented view of your surroundings seen through the headset’s cameras. From there, the headset determines whether you have enough space for active, room-scale experiences, or you can choose a stationary setup for seated play modes. During active play, a virtual barrier called the Oculus Guardian appears when you get close to the edges of your designated play space to help you avoid crashing into your surroundings. It’s all rather clever and effective.</p><p> There’s one other potential hitch with the Oculus Quest 2 that wasn’t present with the original: the new headset_requires_ a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tutorial-how-facebook-works-2654610" >Facebook account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and there’s no way around it. Facebook owns Oculus, and while the first Quest could be used simply with an Oculus account, the new one requires the social media account. For some, that may be a deal-breaker, given frustrations over privacy and the increasing role that Facebook plays in our society, so just know that going in.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049364/7443" target="_top" id="2049364">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049364" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049364/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade"><a href="#Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It’s a big upgrade"></a>Performance: It’s a big upgrade</h2><p> The original Oculus Quest did a fine job of delivering immersive VR experiences that didn’t feel compromised or significantly downgraded, even if it didn’t hit the same visual peaks as pricier, PC-powered headsets. And it was pretty amazing that the Quest did so with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, a chip found in 2017’s flagship smartphones.</p><p> The Oculus Quest 2 takes things to another level, and there are a few reasons why.</p><p> First off, the new Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chip here is based on the current Snapdragon 865 chip seen in phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Note20, and is three generations newer than the old chip.</p><p> It’s also paired with 50 percent more RAM (6GB) than the original Quest. Even more vividly, the fast-switching LCD screen packs in nearly 50 percent more pixels per eye than the old OLED panels did, for a noticeably crisper and smoother experience.</p><p> On the first Quest, you got 1440x1600 resolution per eye: solid, but a bit fuzzy and comparatively lower resolution than some of the PC headsets on the market. Here, however, the single screen provides 1832x1920 per eye, and the difference is obvious. While the switch from OLED to LCD technology should weaken the contrast a bit and dampen the deep black levels, I’ll be honest: I didn’t notice.</p><p> What I did notice was sharper interfaces and smoother action, with more fluid-feeling experiences that exhibited fewer of the occasional-yet-tolerable hitches seen with some games and apps on the first Quest headset.</p><p> Additionally, Oculus recently enabled the Quest 2 to hit a peak 90Hz screen refresh rate, up from 72Hz on the first headset, which will only help deliver that smoother-feeling usage. Developers must enable 90Hz within their apps and games, however.</p><p> I felt the Quest 2’s enhancements more prominently in some games over others. Laser sword-swinging music game Beat Saber, for example, ran well on the first headset and isn’t that different here—just smoother and clearer-looking. But with the online battle royale shooter Population: One, the cleaner-looking textures and more fluid performance helped mitigate some of the light motion sickness I felt playing on the first Quest.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044585/7443" target="_top" id="2044585">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044585" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044585/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones"></a>Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones</h2><p> Plugging in headphones delivers a more closed-off, immersive experience, but the Oculus Quest 2’s built-in speaker does a solid job of delivering audio and music. It does sound a tiny bit louder and fuller than the original Quest’s speaker, but not significantly so. Still, if you want to play without being fully shut-off from your surroundings, it works just fine.</p><h2 id="Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours"><a href="#Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours" class="headerlink" title="Battery: You’ll get a couple hours"></a>Battery: You’ll get a couple hours</h2><p> Like the original headset, the Oculus Quest 2 is rated for 2-3 hours of usage on a full charge. For such a compact, standalone headset, I think that’s reasonable. You get a couple hours to play, and then you can take a breather and do other things while it charges.</p><p> That said, if you’re keen on longer-lasting experiences, Oculus sells a $129 version of the Elite Strap with a built-in battery pack that doubles the play time, or you can get a portable battery pack, plug it in, and stick it in your pocket during use. Lastly, you could just use a lengthy USB-C cable and plug yourself into a wall. If you’re doing room-scale VR games and apps with free movement, however, you’ll need something longer—like 10 feet or more. Otherwise, some seated apps and games will work just fine when you’re tethered to a nearby wall outlet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ns2S3DQVema5UEDDSO8n3N7SC_4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-7-0a0e40b6a3064fe7abc985f0900dbeff.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC"><a href="#Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC" class="headerlink" title="Software: Use the headset or connect to PC"></a>Software: Use the headset or connect to PC</h2><p> The headset’s own interface hasn’t changed much from the first Quest, taking place in a 3D home-like environment with floating menus that you can access via the motion controllers. It’s a pretty easy way to choose between your currently installed games and apps, install anything else in your library, purchase and download new content, and access video content including apps like Netflix, YouTube, and SlingTV.</p><p> Oculus has also enabled optional hand tracking, including the use of hand and finger gestures to get around the interface and interact with some games. Hand tracking is definitely more finicky than using the controllers, however, and you’ll need solid lighting to really rely on it. That said, it does still feel experimental, and I encountered enough misread gestures and incorrect interactions to make me want to stick to the controllers. They work reliably great.</p><p> Since the original Quest’s launch, Oculus added the ability to connect the headset to a powerful PC to run more advanced VR experiences, and that carries over to the Quest 2, as well. You’ll need a PC that is capable of running headsets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as either the official Oculus Link USB-C cable ($80) or a comparable USB 3.1 cable that can handle the high-speed demands. I bought an unofficial cable for half the price on Amazon, and it worked great.</p><p> Using a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, I was able to play the visually demanding and deeply immersive Half-Life: Alyx on the Oculus Quest 2—a game that it could never run using its own internal hardware. It ran a little less smoothly than it did using the PC-native Valve Index headset, but not significantly so. This is a great way to experience higher-end VR games, including the new<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/star-wars-squadrons-review-5086656" >Star Wars: Squadrons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , for example. And with Oculus announcing plans to phase out PC-only headsets, it will also be a key part of the Quest platform’s future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/72vxixVr7kdKoLfUC3QkIrBl26I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-6-12fcb6054cf2475191bc613a3f26bcfc.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The $299 edition of the headset comes with 64GB of internal storage and the $399 version nets you 256GB, with some of each tally taken up by system software and resources. Luckily, the games and apps themselves aren’t huge, typically weighing in between 1-4GB apiece, sometimes less, and they’re pretty quick to download again if you want to revisit something. The 64GB edition should provide enough space for most players, as you could probably comfortably have a dozen or more games installed, along with streaming media apps, but anyone who wants to have a robust VR library on hand at all times without waiting might consider spending the extra cash.</p><h2 id="Games-A-good-growing-selection"><a href="#Games-A-good-growing-selection" class="headerlink" title="Games: A good, growing selection"></a>Games: A good, growing selection</h2><p> Although those aforementioned games and some others are still only found on PC (or maybe PlayStation VR on the PlayStation 4 or 5), the Oculus Quest platform has amassed a very nice selection of native games that you can download and play right on the headset.There is no difference in compatibility between the headsets: all Quest games play on Quest 2 and vice versa, just with performance differences.</p><p> Many of the early games from the impressive Quest launch lineup are still among the best games you can play on the Quest 2. The aforementioned Beat Saber, which finds you swinging your controllers to slash faux lightsabers through soaring rhythmic beats, is a frenetic blast, now with a larger library of songs including BTS and Linkin Park packs. Superhot VR is a stylish hybrid of a shooter and a puzzle game, of sorts, as you figure out how to clear through foes while avoiding incoming bullets that only move when you do. Meanwhile, the Star Wars VR game Vader Immortal still does a great job of creating an authentic atmosphere.</p><p> But there’s so much more now, too. Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite, both from developer Enhance Games, are trippy, trancelike experiences that you can sit down and really savor in VR. Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners and the aforementioned Population: One show that larger-scale shooter experiences can be immersive and compelling in VR, plus there’s a newer Star Wars game, Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge, that blends interactive storytelling with fun blaster battles.</p><p> There’s a lot of great stuff on Quest 2, ranging from simple arcade-like experiences to larger-scale adventures, quirky interactive experiences, and more. And on top of that, there are the aforementioned video services for 360-degree videos, plus fitness apps and games, VR chat for communicating with friends and random people, a web browser, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FqVvo044zoPghSD_PR1g2e0L2rs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-5-216bbf638cbe407b8b6f332abc94ae47.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105874/7443" target="_top" id="2105874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-It’s-an-amazing-value"><a href="#Price-It’s-an-amazing-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s an amazing value"></a>Price: It’s an amazing value</h2><p> The Oculus Quest was already impressively priced at $399, so launching the more powerful Oculus Quest 2 at $299 is pretty phenomenal. Granted, the design compromises are a little frustrating, and I would’ve rather paid more for a better strap and more precise IPD settings like on the original—but those are the tweaks made to try and broaden the market for the Quest and VR as a whole. Still, even with those design annoyances, the Quest 2 is an incredible value for a portable, fully self-contained VR game console.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TDsFPvRGkhZaFzIaNnKRk1_xO4s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-8-Comparison-1b0c51b029da41389167e103a4c4843a.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR"></a>Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR</h2><p> Amazingly, there is no direct analog to the Oculus Quest 2 on the market: Oculus seems to be the only company that can release such a powerful device at this kind of price and with this kind of software support. That said, if I had to compare it to another VR headset, I’d put it up against Sony’s PlayStation VR, which requires a PlayStation 4 or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> console.</p><p> The PSVR is a few years old now and is technically overshadowed by the Quest 2 in terms of screen and controller quality. Still, Sony has amassed some stellar exclusive games thanks to its partnerships with game developers, and the PlayStation VR is a solid, reasonably affordable pickup for anyone who already has a PS4 or PS5 console and wants to dabble in VR. But if you don’t already have the console, and you want to get into VR, go for the dedicated Quest 2 instead. It’ll be cheaper than buying a headset and console together, plus it’s a better VR experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-vr-review-4692684" >Sony PlayStation VR Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The best VR device, all things considered.</strong></p><p> The significant performance upgrade and surprising price drop outweigh some of the annoying design shifts with the Oculus Quest 2, making it the must-have VR headset for just about everyone. Not only does it play a great library of on-headset games, but it can also connect to a powerful PC to play even more games on top of that. Add to that the ease of use, quality gameplay, and immersive visuals, and the Oculus Quest 2 is another brilliant VR game console.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-rift-s-review-4764112" >Oculus Rift S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-go-vr-headset-review-4690298" >Oculus Go Standalone VR Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Quest 2</li><li>Product Brand  Meta</li><li>UPC  815820021292</li><li>Price  $299.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2020</li><li>Weight  1.1 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.54 x 5.61 x 4.02 in.</li><li>Color  Gray</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Android 10</li><li>Processor  Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2</li><li>RAM  6GB</li><li>Storage  64GB&#x2F;256GB</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-integrating-audio-elements-into-facebooks-visual-stories/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Integrating Audio Elements Into Facebook's Visual Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-get-more-out-of-youtube-with-8-handpicked-download-apps/"><u>[New] In 2024, Get More Out of YouTube with 8 Handpicked Download Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-unlock-6-figure-videos-top-hashtag-trends/"><u>[New] Unlock 6-Figure Videos Top Hashtag Trends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-advanced-techniques-with-obs-studio-for-android/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Advanced Techniques with OBS Studio for Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-android-and-ios-leading-titles-mimicking-playstation-games/"><u>[Updated] Android & iOS Leading Titles Mimicking PlayStation Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/effortlessly-transform-mp4-videos-into-vob-with-movavis-cost-free-web-service/"><u>Effortlessly Transform MP4 Videos Into VOB with Movavi's Cost-Free Web Service</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-google-play-location-on-vivo-v29-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Google Play Location On Vivo V29 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-the-art-optimizing-testimonial-creation/"><u>In 2024, Mastering the Art Optimizing Testimonial Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/is-a-continuous-wi-fi-solution-merited/"><u>Is a Continuous Wi-Fi Solution Merited?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/mastering-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-a-detailed-look-at-its-unique-features-including-s-pen-and-dex-support/"><u>Mastering the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 - A Detailed Look at Its Unique Features Including S Pen & Dex Support</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/navigating-with-precision-a-thorough-review-of-the-google-maps-app-for-iphones/"><u>Navigating with Precision: A Thorough Review of the Google Maps App for iPhones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/overwatch-evaluation-an-entertaining-and-competitive-multiplayer-shooting-experience/"><u>Overwatch Evaluation: An Entertaining and Competitive Multiplayer Shooting Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/premier-zones-for-cutting-edge-vr-viewing-for-2024/"><u>Premier Zones for Cutting-Edge VR Viewing for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

From insanely advanced image stabilization to live streaming capabilities, the HERO7 Black is built for more than just action shots.</p><p> We recently got our hands on this tiny powerhouse to see if the improvements in software and video quality are worth its asking price.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Design-Classic-action-camera-design"><a href="#Design-Classic-action-camera-design" class="headerlink" title="Design: Classic action camera design"></a><strong>Design: Classic action camera design</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black measures in at 2.4 x 1.3 x 1.8 inches, so it’s super compact and almost a cube. The device is all black with a very nice rubber casing around the unit that makes it feel soft to the touch.</p><p> The design is very minimal. The power button is located on the right side of the camera and a record button at the top. On the side, there is a door that hides the USB and HDMI ports, and another door on the bottom that conceals the battery and MicroSD port. The front of the camera has a small screen that displays the current settings.</p><p> All these doors protect the camera’s ports from the elements and give it a tough outer shell that’s rugged enough to survive rough falls and submersion in up to 33 feet of water. The HERO7 Black is a great travel camera that can be taken on exotic trips where water adventures and rough terrain are a part of your itinerary.</p><p> While testing the GoPro HERO7 Black we noticed that the body of the device becomes very hot when used for long periods of time. We tested it for a few hours nonstop and noticed it was still very warm even when it was not recording. This can be a big concern if the device is used for long recordings in hot temperatures.</p><h2 id="Display-Bright-and-visible"><a href="#Display-Bright-and-visible" class="headerlink" title="Display: Bright and visible"></a><strong>Display: Bright and visible</strong></h2><p> The back of the GoPro HERO7 Black has a two-inch touchscreen that is bright and easy to read. While testing the camera, we were able to navigate through the menus with the single touch of a finger, which are intuitive and easy to adjust. Simply tap to select.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047351/19272" target="_top" id="2047351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047351/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Updates-out-of-the-box"><a href="#Setup-Updates-out-of-the-box" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Updates out of the box"></a><strong>Setup: Updates out of the box</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black did not have much battery life out of the box. Once we powered it on, we set the date, time, and location. It then prompted us to update the software, which required a blank memory card and fully-charged battery to complete.</p><p> The HERO7 Black has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth compatibility, which makes it easy to pair with a smartphone that has the GoPro App downloaded. We were able to make the camera discoverable in the Preferences menu, and then the app could automatically scan and connect to the camera when it was opened.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Sensor-Small-but-mighty"><a href="#Sensor-Small-but-mighty" class="headerlink" title="Sensor: Small but mighty"></a><strong>Sensor: Small but mighty</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black boasts a 1&#x2F;2.3-inch 12-megapixel sensor that is built for action. The new and improved image processor now has the ability to stabilize footage through electronic image stabilization technology called HyperSmooth. This feature works by tracking unwanted motion in your videos and algorithmically correcting shake. It makes your footage impressively stable even when filming handheld or while riding on rough terrain.</p><p> We took the GoPro out and recorded some handheld video as we walked around, which would normally have some shake to it. The footage from the HERO7 Black was smooth and it did not contain any camera shake, almost as if we’d been using a gimbal.</p><p> It makes your footage impressively stable even when filming handheld or while riding on rough terrain.</p><h2 id="Lens-Great-for-video"><a href="#Lens-Great-for-video" class="headerlink" title="Lens: Great for video"></a><strong>Lens: Great for video</strong></h2><p> The fixed lens on the GoPro HERO7 Black shoots wide or in SuperView mode, the latter of which is an extra-wide field of view and can sometimes give a kind of distorted fisheye effect to your footage. This distortion can be frustrating, but there are ways to work around it during editing, including using video editing software to correct. And when shooting at a lower resolution, the camera can shoot with a linear field of view which reduces the distortion of the lens. The SuperView is not available when shooting in a 4:3 aspect ratio.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123899/26106" target="_top" id="2123899">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123899" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123899/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Video-Quality-Amazing-4K-quality-with-variable-frame-rates"><a href="#Video-Quality-Amazing-4K-quality-with-variable-frame-rates" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality: Amazing 4K quality with variable frame rates"></a><strong>Video Quality: Amazing 4K quality with variable frame rates</strong></h2><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> quality of the GoPro HERO7 Black is gorgeous. Content creators and travel vloggers will absolutely appreciate this camera’s recording capabilities.</p><p> While testing the GoPro HERO7 Black, the 4K video looked its best when recording in bright lighting conditions. In lower light, the quality began to degrade and grain started to form in the shadow areas of the scene.</p><p> New to the GoPro HERO7 is the ability to create a TimeWarp video. This feature allows the user to create super smooth time-lapse videos with HyperSmooth technology, so the camera doesn’t have to be stationary. This opens up the ability to be more creative when making time lapse videos.</p><p> The ability to capture 1080p video at 240fps is also a game-changer. The slow-motion feature of this camera is stunning, producing beautiful smooth footage, especially when used in bright lighting conditions. If you’re an athlete looking to record and analyze footage of yourself, the HERO7 Black gives you a great way to slow down footage and study movement.</p><p> The GoPro HERO7 also has a live stream feature. Using the GoPro app, you can set up a live video feed by connecting to your Facebook, YouTube, and various other social media networks. Once connected to the desired account, you will be able to go live within minutes.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Photo-Quality-Nothing-to-brag-about"><a href="#Photo-Quality-Nothing-to-brag-about" class="headerlink" title="Photo Quality: Nothing to brag about"></a><strong>Photo Quality: Nothing to brag about</strong></h2><p> The photo quality on the GoPro HERO7 Black is average, though it does have the ability to create HDR (High Dynamic Range) images.</p><p> Due to the lens distortion, the images that this camera produces have a specific look that you may either love or hate. It also has a fixed lens that does not zoom, so that limits its functionality compared to typical point-and-shoot cameras.</p><p> But generally speaking, the GoPro HERO7 Black is not a camera known for its stunning photographs—it is known for its stunning video capabilities. It’s not for someone that wants to use it specifically for still photographs.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Sensitive-to-the-touch"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Sensitive-to-the-touch" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Sensitive to the touch"></a><strong>Sound Quality: Sensitive to the touch</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black’s microphones are sensitive and record ambient noise easily. The microphones are located on the body of the camera and any slight touch becomes audible in your video. When taking some handheld footage, we accidentally covered up the microphones with our fingers, which caused the audio to sound muffled in our video.</p><p> The ability to add external microphones turns the GoPro HERO7 Black from an action camera to a high-quality video camera.</p><p> The internal microphones are useful if the sound is not a priority in your videos, but if great audio is a necessity, it is best to invest in an external microphone. You can connect one to the HERO7 Black through the USB connection, which opens up possibilities for external microphones, lapel mics, and digital audio recorders to enhance sound recording capabilities.</p><p> The ability to add external microphones turns the GoPro HERO7 Black from an action camera to a high-quality video camera. Pairing the 4K resolution with great audio quality, this camera becomes a powerful tool in the hands of the right content creator.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Speedy-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-pairing"><a href="#Connectivity-Speedy-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-pairing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Speedy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth pairing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Speedy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth pairing</strong></h2><p> Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze with the GoPro HERO7 Black. Once we installed the GoPro app on our smartphone, the camera connected instantly. The app also gave us a much larger and easier-to-read interface, plus a live view function that allowed us to use our phone to frame and compose videos and remotely control the camera.</p><p> Inside the app, there are also options to edit mode settings, change the original set up, review camera info, changed Wi-Fi remotes, as well as monitor the battery level and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-format-sd-card-camera-4587017" >SD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> capacity.

For those who are considering the GoPro as a vlogging camera, the PowerShot is another great option. It records video at 1080p rather than 4K, but it has a larger 20.3-megapixel sensor and a 180-degree articulating LCD touchscreen display that’s perfect for self-recording.</p><p> The Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II utilizes an advanced DIGIC 7 Image Processor, which creates better photographs than the GoPro HERO7 Black. This image processor also provides better video stabilization and autofocusing for video, though it’s admittedly not as advanced as the GoPro’s HyperSmooth feature.</p><p> Comparing this to the GoPro HERO7 Black, the Canon is much more user-friendly. It’s a better fit for those that want a versatile camera that they can grab and use easily, without having to maneuver through menus on a tiny screen.</p><p><strong><em>Canon PowerShot SX740 HS:</em></strong> Retailing for $400, the Canon PowerShot SX740 HS is right on par price-wise with the GoPro HERO7 Black. The PowerShot is also capable of recording 4K video, but it lacks the frame rates that the GoPro HERO7 Black is capable of. It’s also capable of capturing photos without distortion, which makes it a more versatile camera.</p><p> The PowerShot SX740 HS is geared toward someone that wants a little bit of everything. It can shoot 4K and take photographs, but it doesn’t quite live up to the excellent video quality of the GoPro. The PowerShot is also a more user-friendly device that is suited for people familiar with standard point-and-shoot cameras.</p><p> The camera also has a 180-degree adjustable LCD screen, which makes it an even more powerful tool for vloggers.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/canon-powershot-sx740-hs-review-4705542" >Canon PowerShot SX740 HS Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A rugged and compact action camera with fantastic video stabilization.</strong></p><p> Between the amazing video quality and the enhanced HyperSmooth electronic image stabilization, the GoPro HERO7 Black is perfect for adventurers who want to record or even live-stream their most rugged expeditions.
