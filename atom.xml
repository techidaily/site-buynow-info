Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Upgraded Sumind Bluetooth FM Transmitter is a larger Bluetooth device that works through your car’s existing stereo system. You can connect nearly any Bluetooth-enabled device and enjoy your music or hands-free calling. We investigated Sumind’s interesting design, usability, audio quality, and the special features that make it stand out from the competition.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Benjamin Zeman</p><h2 id="Design-User-friendly-design"><a href="#Design-User-friendly-design" class="headerlink" title="Design: User friendly design"></a><strong>Design: User friendly design</strong></h2><p> The Sumind Bluetooth Car FM Transmitter has two main parts connected with a flexible gooseneck. The part that plugs into a car’s 12V power outlet has both an intelligent 5V&#x2F;2.4<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> charging port and a QC3.0 charging port. At the tip of the side that plugs into your car is an extended removable piece with a replaceable fuse. It’s not clear whether that additional piece was at fault, but we found the device more difficult to plug in than others we tested.</p><p> On the opposite side of the gooseneck is the device’s main body. On the front is a large 1.7 inch<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-liquid-crystal-display-lcd-2625913" >LCD screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that displays information bright and clear but only at limited viewing angles. Sumind advertises that the gooseneck can be rotated 270 degrees but we found that when we tried to angle the display towards us in the driver’s seat, the gooseneck wouldn’t stay in position. Instead it would snapback, leading us to believe that unless the gooseneck needs to be “broken in” with a little more movement there’s closer to 180 degrees of rotation.</p><p> The fact that the primary input function of the aux port is so crippled is a significant downside, and if you’re mainly looking to connect a device via aux a likely dealbreaker.</p><p> There’s a large multifunction button and volume knob under the display with a ring around it that lights up when the device is powered on. On the left side are + and - buttons to adjust the radio frequency channel and on the right are next&#x2F;last buttons to navigate songs. The buttons are fairly large and easy to use.</p><p> On the left side of the body is a TF slot so you can play audio files from a MicroSD card. On the right is a 3.5mm auxiliary jack that is advertised as_both_ an input and an output (more on that later). Since the body is on a flexible gooseneck, it’s easy to get to both the TF slot and the aux jack. With the large buttons and display, the Sumind transmitter is designed to be very user friendly.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-but-hard-to-angle"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-but-hard-to-angle" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy but hard to angle"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy but hard to angle</strong></h2><p> We tested this transmitter in a 2018 Toyota RAV4, which has two 12V auxiliary power outlets under the dash. Getting the Sumind transmitter into a position we could see from the driver’s seat was impossible. Although the screen is bright and easy to read from straight on, the viewing angles are poor and even with the amount of rotation the gooseneck allowed we couldn’t get it pointed straight at us.</p><p> The transmitter plugged right into our car’s 12V power outlet and we easily paired it to our phone over Bluetooth. We matched an empty FM radio frequency on our radio to an FM frequency on the device and audio worked right away. Listening to music and taking phone calls was easy and intuitive.</p><p> Using the TF card slot is as simple as putting in a card that has audio files in a supported format. The next&#x2F;last buttons on the right are used to navigate through your songs. Switching between Bluetooth and charging mode is done by holding the next song button for five seconds. Overall setup was a breeze.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148644/16836" target="_top" id="2148644">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148644" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148644/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Loud-and-clear"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Loud-and-clear" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Loud and clear"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Loud and clear</strong></h2><p> We were impressed with the Sumind Bluetooth Car FM Transmitter’s clear, low-noise audio. The BT70B has good noise- and interference-reduction technology and it’s evident in the high-quality audio. Audio is streamed over bluetooth version 4.2 and the TF slot supports FAT formatted MicroSD cards up to 32GB with MP3 or WMA audio files.</p><p> The BT70B has good noise- and interference-reduction technology and it’s evident in the high-quality audio.</p><p> Call quality was just as good as music and podcasts. The built-in microphone works well and hearing our buddy on the other end of a call wasn’t a problem. Overall we found the audio quality to be really solid, with the exception of one of Sumind’s special features—an aux jack that supports both input and output. Let’s take a closer look at this oddity.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Benjamin Zeman</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068426/7443" target="_top" id="2068426">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068426" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068426/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Features-The-weirdest-feature-we’ve-seen"><a href="#Features-The-weirdest-feature-we’ve-seen" class="headerlink" title="Features: The weirdest feature we’ve seen"></a><strong>Features: The weirdest feature we’ve seen</strong></h2><p> The only truly unique difference between the Sumind Bluetooth Car FM Transmitter and many others like it is its unusual input&#x2F;output combo jack. Honestly, the only reason we can think of for a 3.5mm aux jack that works both as an input and an output is that Sumind used jacks that just happened to have a chipset that also supports output.</p><p> It’s a novel feature, but the problem is that the aux input is plagued with issues. We thought at first the jack might be broken, but the aux output worked flawlessly. The included aux cable that came with the transmitter was really low quality and super noisy when we tested it with another transmitter, but when we used a known working aux cable it still didn’t work. Then we plugged the cable from the aux output of the transmitter into the aux input of our car. It was lower volume than any other audio but it worked.</p><p> Of course, the use cases for a 3.5mm output are extremely limited. The fact that the primary input function of the aux port is so crippled is a significant downside, and if you’re mainly looking to connect a device via aux a likely dealbreaker.</p><h2 id="Software-High-quality-as-expected"><a href="#Software-High-quality-as-expected" class="headerlink" title="Software: High quality, as expected"></a><strong>Software: High quality, as expected</strong></h2><p> Sumind’s large display allows a large amount of information to be displayed, and the software handles it well. It does an excellent job of surfacing the most important information. There’s an icon showing whether or not Bluetooth is on, if a track is paused or playing, the volume level, the FM frequency, and what device the transmitter is connected to. Every software function worked great and we didn’t notice any lag or glitches.</p><p> The BT70B is an excellent current gen transmitter and an easy, inexpensive way to add Bluetooth functionality to your vehicle.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105876/7443" target="_top" id="2105876">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105876" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105876/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Slightly-higher-than-average"><a href="#Price-Slightly-higher-than-average" class="headerlink" title="Price: Slightly higher than average"></a><strong>Price: Slightly higher than average</strong></h2><p> The Sumind BT70B transmitter averages around $26 and can sometimes be found for less with a little bargain hunting. It’s on the higher end of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-fm-transmitters-for-car-1999388" >Bluetooth transmitters we’ve tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> but it packs all the features we want, except for a working auxiliary input. We often use a portable music player and an aux input is a must.</p><p> Sumind’s offering is otherwise a solid value. It’s got everything else you need and good audio quality to boot. Couple that with the large, user-friendly buttons and you have a winner.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137206/26400" target="_top" id="2137206">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137206" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137206/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Sumind-BT70B-vs-Nulaxy-KM18"><a href="#Competition-Sumind-BT70B-vs-Nulaxy-KM18" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Sumind BT70B vs. Nulaxy KM18"></a><strong>Competition: Sumind BT70B vs. Nulaxy KM18</strong></h2><p> The Nulaxy KM18 is an older gen model with all the same functionality as the Sumind BT70B and can usually found between $17 and $20. If you’re looking to save a few dollars the Nulaxy could be a good bet.</p><p> It also has good audio quality with low noise, easy to use buttons, and an aux jack that works. However, the display is smaller and more difficult to see and like Sumind’s transmitter the gooseneck cable isn’t very flexible.</p><p> The KM18 is an older gen model from 2015 and has been a very popular option for years. Nulaxy also makes an upgraded KM18 Plus version. We think all three are good options that justify their price tag. If we didn’t need a working aux input we’d probably choose the Sumind, especially because we prefer the shape of the chassis and the convenience of two USB charging ports.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nulaxy-km18-bluetooth-car-fm-transmitter-review-4771222" >Nulaxy KM18 Bluetooth Car FM Transmitter Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The Sumind BT70B</strong>   <strong>Bluetooth FM Transmitter is a good buy with some quality control issues.</strong></p><p> We like Sumind’s shape and the large, easy-to-use buttons and dial. It has the largest and best looking display we saw in this round of testing and audio sounded great from any source. Outside of our issues with the aux port, the BT70B is an excellent current gen transmitter and an easy, inexpensive way to add Bluetooth functionality to your vehicle.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  BT70B Bluetooth FM Transmitter</li><li>Product Brand  Sumind</li><li>UPC  BT70B</li><li>Price  $26.00</li><li>Weight  3.36 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.09 x 2.24 x 8.41 in.</li><li>Color  Black, Blue, Silver Grey</li><li>Ports  QC 3.0 and 5V&#x2F;2.4A USB charge ports, 3.5mm auxiliary, TF Card</li><li>Mic  Yes</li><li>Audio Connectivity Options  Bluetooth, TF Card, Aux Cable</li><li>Formats Supported  MP3, WMA</li><li>Removable Cable  3.5mm auxiliary cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-quick-guide-to-incor-written-as-a-python-list-which-represents-the-30-titles-above-the-elements-of-this-list-should-be-strings-that-are-already-complete/"><u>[New] Quick Guide to Incor Written as a Python List, Which Represents the 30 Titles Above.

It has all the charm you’d expect from a Nintendo console. It takes seconds to start up, its menu system is easy to figure out, and its game catalog is fantastic.</p><p> It’s starting to show its age with slower performance on some games but it’s worth the longer loading times.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>OLED screen looks fantastic</li><li>Extensive catalog of exclusive games</li><li>Can connect it to TV</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Hardware is starting to show its age</li><li>No performance updates beyond the display</li></ul><p> Nothing about the Nintendo Switch OLED is clunky. The only ads you’ll see are for Nintendo services, so it’s very family-friendly. Game options include all your childhood favorites, including plenty of new versions of Mario, like Super Mario Odyssey and Super Mario Wonder, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and the Legend of Zelda franchise.</p><p> There’s some comfort here, but the Nintendo Switch OLED still has room for more adult games like Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy.</p><p> You can<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-nintendo-switch-controller-5218934" >leave games in sleep mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so you can quickly resume where you left off, which is useful if you need to pause while traveling.</p><p> Back home, you can plug the console into your TV via the included dock to gather around as a family to play multiplayer games or enjoy a single-player session on a bigger screen. This feels less essential solo than with previous Switches, as the OLED screen looks great, but it’s nice to have the option.</p><p> Online play requires<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nintendo-switch-online-4175784" >Nintendo Switch Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a paid service that offers emulated versions of old favorites from past consoles.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, Wired, T3, Tom’s Guide, Digital Trends, and CNET recommend the Nintendo Switch OLED.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> 90% of buyers on Amazon have rated the Nintendo Switch OLED five stars, with the console having an average score of 4.8 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Also-Great"><a href="#Also-Great" class="headerlink" title="Also Great"></a>Also Great</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M" >Valve Steam Deck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0UYqsaz73PWhH6z5ksLDbIhSU-w=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SteamDeckOLED2-3ea64c8ac24943b5b4eb2e57f9ffe6f7.jpg" >Steam Deck OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M" >https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M" >$450 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Valve-Steam-Deck-64-GB/2237665775" >$459 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" >$399 at Steampowered.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The Steam Deck makes PC gaming truly portable and much simpler than ever before. It’s all within a sleek and easy to hold shell with a great screen whether you go LED or OLED. As with the Switch, you can always dock it, and even install Windows if you want a full portable PC.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Steam Deck is effectively a portable PC. Designed like a Nintendo Switch, it provides easy access to your Steam library thanks to running SteamOS, Valve’s Linux-based operating system.</p><p> While you might be thinking, a gaming laptop does all that, the Steam Deck is far more portable than any gaming laptop.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Highly customizable</li><li>Huge range of games via Steam</li><li>More accessible PC gaming</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Battery life can be poor</li><li>Customization can get very complicated</li></ul><p> Because the Steam Deck is built like a Nintendo Switch, it feels very portable. Its either 7-inch LCD or 7.4-inch OLED screen ensures you can see plenty of what’s going on without the bulk of a 14- —to 17-inch laptop screen.</p><p> Due to its size, it won’t play games at the highest detail level but it still looks good and aligns well with the screen size involved. You can always dock it with your TV, like the Nintendo Switch, if you prefer.</p><p> Regular PC gamers like me will already have extensive Steam libraries to explore, and there are often sales on the Steam store, meaning the Steam Deck can provide good value over time.</p><p> Not every game on the store is compatible with the Steam Deck, but the number is growing rapidly.</p><p> Technically minded people can also spend time customizing the device, either installing Windows to extend their options or other game launchers like Battle.net or the Epic Games Store Launcher. It’s fun to tinker with.</p><p> Battery life could be better, but the Steam Deck truly is a PC in your hands, so that’s to be expected. Otherwise, it’s a lot of fun, and I’ve enjoyed catching up with my Steam library in a couch-friendly format.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> The Verge, Forbes, IGN, PCGamer, and Wired have all recommended the Steam Deck with the Steam Deck OLED considered a particular highlight.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Steam Deck has sold over 3 million units on the Steam website. Relatively recently featured on Amazon, it has 86% four- or five-star ratings across 564 reviews.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135397/19272" target="_top" id="2135397">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135397" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135397/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Mega-Tech-Capcom-Super-Pocket-Retro-System/5194946970" >Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/B5s9keNJcOmzNUWzyuCLkCGE1fc=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HyperMegaTechSuperPocket1-e0c2f7f305d143ad9cf64143fbe17afd.jpg" >Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Mega-Tech-Capcom-Super-Pocket-Retro-System/5194946970" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Mega-Tech-Capcom-Super-Pocket-Retro-System/5194946970 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Mega-Tech-Capcom-Super-Pocket-Retro-System/5194946970" >$60 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/blaze-entertainment-hyper-mega-tech-taito-super-pocket-green-black/6549862.p?skuId=6549862" >$56 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Old enough to remember the Nintendo Game Boy?

It feels like holding a Game Boy, and it’s very lightweight.</p><p> True to its name, the Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket fits in your pocket. The controls take a brief time to get used to, as they’re quite close together and there are a handful of buttons on the back panel, but they’re reasonably well placed.</p><p> The Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket is far more than just whichever edition you buy, as it also supports Evercade cartridges. There are over 45 cartridges available, providing access to over 500 retro games at relatively low prices.</p><p> Titles include Duke Nukem, Tomb Raider, Flashback, and Pac-Man.

On top of this, OLED frames are thinner and lighter than their LED predecessors. It’s a powerful combination that makes for a startlingly realistic picture alongside an expanded range of placement options. In the case of the LG C9, it’s a design that’s as smart as it is sleek thanks to the inclusion of Google Assistant and Alexa.</p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED 65-inch C9 (OLED65C9PUA).</p><p> The LG C9 itself is comprised of a pane of glass that covers the OLED panel. This pane stretches across the front of the TV, leaving a remarkable 0.3 inches between the end of the OLED panel and the metal edge. When it is mounted on a wall, the C9 looks fantastic thanks to this slim, bezel-less design, and while it boasts an impressive 65-inch screen, at no point does this top-of-the-line model exceed a width of 1.8 inches.</p><p> For customers with multiple external devices, such as Blu-ray players or gaming consoles, ports are located along the TV’s left-hand side and directly on its backside. These connection options include 4<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 2.1 ports, 3<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, one cable&#x2F;antenna input, one LAN port, and audio connections. The HDMI 2.1 ports are especially important since consoles began emerging in 2020 that rely on HDMI 2.1 such as the Playstation 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mxKfDJGuIKYcsSIQoKfzwDbYYmg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_02-3da87ff8439343f691cf02e9234d1f04.jpg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand"><a href="#Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand"></a><strong>Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand</strong></h2><p> Due to its large size and fragile nature, consider where the LG C9 will be most secure before moving ahead with setup. It shouldn’t be placed anywhere where there’s a risk it could be knocked down or climbed on, for instance, so choose a location safely tucked away from pets and children.</p><p> Setup options include securing the TV to the wall or using the provided stand as a table mount. Be careful, however, as the slim frame means that it needs to be handled with care regardless of where it’s placed, otherwise the TV is at risk of bending which could damage the OLED panel. You’ll want to make sure you’ve got an extra pair of hands for any lifting or adjusting in order to ensure its safety.</p><p> The LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended.</p><p> We found the mounting setup process to be straightforward for an afternoon DIY project. When choosing a wall mount, be sure to consider your individual needs as not all mounts are compatible with all building materials. If you have a plaster or masonry, for instance, you’re going to need stronger hardware than a typical mount has to offer. If you have drywall then the majority of TV mounts will be compatible with your home.</p><p> The other important factor when selecting a mount is the weight and screen size the mount is capable of holding. In this case, these measurements are 65 inches and 56 pounds. After this, considerations are based on preferences rather than hardware limitations. Do you want your mount to be fixed or flexible? Would you prefer installing the TV at eye level or would you like it to rest higher? Will you be placing it in a corner or on a flat wall? These are important questions to ask because they influence the kind of mount you’ll bring home. When in doubt, most manufacturers include a compatibility check for the TV’s make and model on their website. If you’re not comfortable measuring, leveling, and drilling into studs, it’s well worth the peace of mind to hire a handyman once you’ve made your selection.</p><p> Once the TV has been installed, LG’s WebOS guides the first-time setup process by prompting inputs for settings ranging from time zone and language up to and including any necessary user agreements. The LG C9 will complete a scan in order to identify the devices and then you’re free to customize the TV’s settings by pressing the gear button on the LG Magic Remote. The first setting we changed was the Auto Power Saving (APS) picture mode, which reduces power use by dimming the brightness of the TV. The other important setting to disable is TruMotion, which smooths motion in TV shows and movies by altering the frame rate of the programming. If your LG’s picture looks a bit too much like a soap opera, chances are you need to disable this setting.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Stunning-picture"><a href="#Image-Quality-Stunning-picture" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Stunning picture"></a><strong>Image Quality: Stunning picture</strong></h2><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off. Even from wide viewing angles, the 4K picture maintains its excellence, with limited washing out and color loss.</p><p> John Wick’s dynamic action scenes and stunning backdrops shine through in gorgeous, gritty detail in_Parabellum_ ; magical realism pops off the screen in Elton John’s biopic_Rocketman_ ; and the intricate wonders of the natural world appear in extraordinarily sharp detail in_Planet Earth II_ .</p><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off.</p><p> These pictures are further enhanced with LG’s α9 Gen 2 intelligent processor, new to 2019’s model. It excels at drawing out detail and correcting quality discrepancies within the picture, such as banding which creates textures and strips in areas of the screen that would otherwise be smooth. This is particularly important given the large screen size and high resolution. While it’s not as bright as an LED TV since it lacks backlighting, it doesn’t need it as the TV already possesses excellent color, a change here would risk washing out the inky blacks on the screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947746/11832" target="_top" id="947746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947746/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Better-than-expected"><a href="#Audio-Better-than-expected" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Better than expected"></a><strong>Audio: Better than expected</strong></h2><p> While OLED TVs aren’t generally known for their great sound quality, the LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended. Audio in TV or movies is generally good, but it struggles to regulate loud and soft noises in a scene. Streaming Lizzo’s_Cuz I Love You_ on Spotify produces a surprising depth of sound, but it’s simply not comparable to a more robust system that a soundbar or home theater system would provide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SZUaFESJi6OZubIeLdK1e9L9FEM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_04-c559e4cc6de64f0c8baf4470f883dd9e-4844a7694fb74eb2904f1128ba93f760.jpeg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use"><a href="#Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Software: Smooth and easy to use"></a><strong>Software: Smooth and easy to use</strong></h2><p> As with earlier models, the LG WebOS powers the C9. It’s a user-friendly interface that makes navigating the TV incredibly smooth, enabling you to switch between apps and features built into the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with ease. Meanwhile, the LG Magic Remote can function as a traditional remote control, as a mouse would for a computer screen, or issue voice commands with Google Assistant and Alexa, making navigating the menus second nature. While most major streaming services are already included (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, to name a few) it’s also possible to download additional apps through the LG store. The drawback to the store, however, is that the apps are somewhat limited in availability.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon’s Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It makes it easy to search content, switch between apps and features, or check the weather, among other things. These controls extend into your home as well, enabling you to make use of any basic home control features already in place like updating the temperature on your Nest Smart Thermostat. You simply choose which assistant you want at a given time by pressing either the Amazon button on the Magic Remote to toggle Alexa or the microphone button to toggle Google Assistant.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with Google Assistant as well as Amazon’s Alexa.

The LG C9 is a premium 4K TV that sits at the top of this curve, offering integrated smart technologies and excellent picture with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface. As such, it comes at a premium price of $2,500 (Amazon) that exceeds the cost of many competitor models, but with so many additional features it’s worth the high price—even if it’s difficult to swallow.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-60-inch-tvs-4580159" >How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037474/7443" target="_top" id="2037474">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037474" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037474/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R"><a href="#LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R" class="headerlink" title="LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R"></a><strong>LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R</strong></h2><p> It’s easy to see why the LG C9 is such an attractive model. Between its many bells and whistles, it offers superior quality at a premium price. For users looking for a more down-to-earth price point, QLED TV models offer great picture quality at a lower cost and are a major competitor for OLED models.</p><p> The Samsung 65-Inch Class Q60R (QN65Q60RAFXZA) is a QLED TV that relies on edge lighting behind its screen to transmit light. This light shines through quantum dots within the LED panel which then transmit color through to the screen and create a picture. This differs from the LG C9 model which toggles pixels on and off individually to create inkier blacks and better contrast. While this isn’t a deal breaker for the Q60R, it does mean that the LG C9 panel will have a little more punch since it’s better equipped to balance bright whites with darker blacks.</p><p> If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> The Q60R also uses Bixby, Samsung’s AI assistant. Unfortunately, the Bixby integration feels somewhat clunky. It’s not uncommon to repeat instructions when Bixby has difficulty understanding basic instructions. The other caveat to be aware of is that the picture does wash out slightly and lose color when looked at from wide viewing angles. If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> Unlike OLED models, QLED models aren’t prone to burn-in. This is a condition where discoloration occurs over a portion of the screen. This happens when OLED TVs are left on the same channel for extensive periods of time. The Q60R also doubles as an excellent gaming TV or monitor thanks to its variable refresh rates and low input lag which allows the screen to adjust the refresh rate to that of the source. While the C9 also has a variable refresh rate and a low input lag, its variable refresh rate is only compatible with the Xbox One for now since nothing else uses HDMI 2.1 yet. Generally retailing for around $1,000, the Q60R is less than half the cost of the LG C9, making it a better choice for those concerned about price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-q60r-series-qled-4k-tv-review-4782061" >Samsung Q60R Series QLED 4K TV Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An excellent TV you shouldn’t hesitate to buy if you value ease of use and superb image quality.</strong></p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED C9. That said, these improvements aren’t significant leaps, mainly coming from processor improvements and the addition of HDMI 2.1 ports. If you’re simply looking for the best TV from last year and price isn’t a consideration, look no further. On the other hand, there are other great 65-inch 4K TV models that may not have all the extra features the C9 does, but do have comparable quality without breaking the bank.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983584">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983584.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983584">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983584.png"                      style="border: none;

Buyers should probably make sure that they can’t get away with a smaller, cheaper, simpler solution first, but if or when that fails, this antenna definitely gets the job done.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vY1j7QoS0FLwOKNhPlSfR3XMlmo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_02-e97897fe03b74f5faa2eefad3b3b7208.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947746/11832" target="_top" id="947746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947746/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future"><a href="#Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Glimpsing an ugly future"></a><strong>Design: Glimpsing an ugly future</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna looks something like what I would imagine a space prison to look like. It’s far larger than any of the other antennas that I tested, and during every step of the assembly I kept thinking to myself “well that part can’t possibly be necessary.” From the comically long antennas and giant metal grate, to the bulbous hollowed out spheres, there is a lot going on here.</p><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup.</p><p> As you’ll see later though, this is because the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna doesn’t really care about looks. Everything is 100% about function. There are, however, a few little elements from a design perspective that help make the ClearStream a somewhat thoughtful device nonetheless. Once assembled, all the parts fit together nicely like a lego set.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983552">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983552.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983552">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983552.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983552%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983552/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Buckle-up"><a href="#Setup-Buckle-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Buckle up"></a><strong>Setup: Buckle up</strong></h2><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup. The instructions that come included have illustrations that show how everything fits together, but it isn’t outlined in the simplest manner possible.</p><p> Like a piece of IKEA furniture, the specific orientation of a lot of parts matter, even if they appear to fit together multiple ways. The manual doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining this, and I could see it leading to some frustration. Once you get the cage in place and secured, the rest of it comes together fairly easily though.</p><p> Once the entire device is assembled, the real work begins in my opinion. Now you have to figure out how and where to mount this beast of an antenna. Antenna’s Direct has you covered here, including a hefty bracket and swiveling mast that will help you mount the antenna to just about anywhere with a flat surface that you don’t mind screwing some bolts into.</p><h2 id="Performance-Top-tier"><a href="#Performance-Top-tier" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Top tier"></a><strong>Performance: Top tier</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception. I tested the antenna indoors along with the rest of the suite of indoor antennas, and in the same orientation. Perhaps it would have benefited from being placed outside, but in the interest of fairness I used the same method for all.</p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception.</p><p> In my channel acquisition test, the ClearStream managed 76 channels consistently, far and away the best result from any of the devices I tested. The worst antenna I tested picked up just 47 channels, and the second best, 69. Needless to say, all the wires, cages, and bulbous plastic spheres are clearly doing something here, because this was the best result I saw.</p><h2 id="Range-Extensive"><a href="#Range-Extensive" class="headerlink" title="Range: Extensive"></a><strong>Range: Extensive</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is rated for up to 60 miles. These ratings are generally based on relatively unobstructed paths between the signal and your device. There is a lot less than 60 miles between me and my local TV broadcast source, but if the other results are any indication, the ClearStream has a fighting chance at living up to these claims.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NoQoQy3-EFUpi1z9oMTpD2JGWHQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_04-70f5a48ac9a347d286c71240b85cbc1c.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012406/19272" target="_top" id="2012406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap"><a href="#Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap"></a><strong>Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has a list price of $120 and a 90-day rolling average price on Amazon of $83. This is significantly more than any of the other antennas I tested, some of which could be had for around $25. If you live far enough that you need a better performing antenna, however, it could easily be worth every penny. I would only caution buyers to make sure they really do need this performance before pulling the trigger on this very large antenna.</p><h2 id="ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> I figured it might be interesting to compare the cheapest antenna to the most expensive antenna. If you are living inside of a city, fairly close to a signal source, you can probably get away with a cheaper antenna like the $25 amplified antenna by manufacturer 1byone. This flat, simple antenna takes up far less space and still managed to get 59 channels. It also maintained a clear picture on all of the major network stations just fine.</p><p> If you live further or in a more obstructed path, however, the 1byone probably wouldn’t cut it at all. It’s rather all-or-nothing. If you do genuinely need a more capable antenna, it could be make or break for your TV-viewing experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great performance for those that need it.</strong><br> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna isn’t the cheapest or best-looking antenna on the market, but it gets the job done better than any of the other antennas we tested. Buyers who know they need an antenna with better range and performance will find this to be a noticeable bump from cheaper indoor antennas.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137211/26400" target="_top" id="2137211">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137211" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137211/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  ClearStream</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2012</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  60 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-maximize-online-sales-the-most-reliable-15-facebook-analysis-tools/"><u>[New] In 2024, Maximize Online Sales The Most Reliable 15 Facebook Analysis Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-secrets-to-designing-impactful-igtv-thumbnails/"><u>[New] In 2024, Secrets to Designing Impactful IGTV Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-insights-into-a-common-symbol-the-blue-emoji-in-fb-chat/"><u>[Updated] Insights Into a Common Symbol The Blue Emoji in FB Chat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/addressing-roblox-error-262-anomaly/"><u>Addressing Roblox: Error 262 Anomaly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/exploring-nighttime-clarity-with-j5s-innovative-v1-pro-flashlight-a-detailed-review-for-seekers-of-compact-brilliance/"><u>Exploring Nighttime Clarity with J5's Innovative V1-Pro Flashlight: A Detailed Review for Seekers of Compact Brilliance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/futureproofing-your-home-network-leading-cable-modems-of-2024-reviewed/"><u>Futureproofing Your Home Network: Leading Cable Modems of 2024 Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-expert-insights-into-mov-file-recording-on-latest-win-11-edition/"><u>In 2024, Expert Insights Into .MOV File Recording on Latest Win 11 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-masters-of-digital-avengers-realms/"><u>In 2024, Masters of Digital Avengers Realms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-7-skype-hacker-to-hack-any-skype-account-on-your-samsung-galaxy-xcover-7-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 7 Skype Hacker to Hack Any Skype Account On your Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-asus-x441ba-navigating-the-pros-and-cons-of-a-large-display-portable/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of Asus X441BA: Navigating the Pros and Cons of a Large Display Portable</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-docoolers-12-mp-usb-camera-is-it-worth-your-attention/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of Docooler's 12 MP USB Camera -

Unfortunately, there are also several areas where it falls short. I tested the Samsung C27F591 for two weeks, evaluating its design, setup process, image and sound quality, and performance, to see how it stacks up against other monitors on the market.</p><p> Check out our guide to the best budget gaming monitors you can buy today.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/977686/11832" target="_top" id="977686">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-977686" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/977686/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Sleek-but-a-bit-wobbly"><a href="#Design-Sleek-but-a-bit-wobbly" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek, but a bit wobbly"></a><strong>Design: Sleek, but a bit wobbly</strong></h2><p> The curved screen on the C27F591 monitor is surrounded by an extremely thin silver bezel. There’s also a thin black interior border, but it’s barely noticeable. With a screen that stretches nearly edge-to-edge, the CF591 looks elegant and refined. The back of the monitor is a gloss-white plastic finish. Although the gloss-plastic finish is somewhat cheap-looking, it’s easy to maintain. You can easily wipe the surface clean and keep the back of the monitor free of dust and fingerprints.</p><p> The power button sits in the bottom-left-hand corner on the back of the monitor, and it also doubles as the menu-control joystick, which allows you to adjust the settings on the C27F591. The joystick is incredibly intuitive and user-friendly, and it sits out of the way so you don’t have to worry too much about accidental button presses or settings changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6aF2msW3brcK_JTXW4APn-C3wGQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4163673-3-ae16d6d969574c7d87002351f6de3f19.jpg"                      alt="Samsung CF591 Curved LED Monitor"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> The monitor’s stand is somewhat unique. Although the stand takes up a decent amount of desk space it’s aesthetically pleasing, and it almost gives the monitor a floating effect. The large, circular base is about 10-inches in diameter, but the base doesn’t feel sturdy because the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-monitor-arms-4153781" >monitor’s arm <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is too thin and long. If you bump into your desk, the monitor will wobble quite a bit because the stand’s thin arm makes the monitor a bit top-heavy. You can tilt the monitor (from -2 to 20 degrees), but it doesn’t offer any height adjustment.</p><p> The ports sit on the backside of the device, and they’re positioned near the bottom of the monitor, but they’re also positioned smack dab in the center, as opposed to being offset to the left or right. The ports are located directly above where the arm of the stand connects to the monitor, and this makes it a bit difficult to conceal your wiring. There’s a hook on the stand where you can tuck your cables, but they don’t tuck away as nicely as they would if the ports were offset.</p><p> Although this monitor is relatively large, there are no mounting holes whatsoever on the back panel, so you can’t just slap on a VESA mount. To wall-mount or desk-mount the C27F591 you’d have to use an adapter kit.</p><p> With a screen that stretches nearly edge-to-edge, the CF591 looks elegant and refined.</p><h2 id="Setup-process-Stand-plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-process-Stand-plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup process: Stand, plug, and play"></a><strong>Setup process: Stand, plug, and play</strong></h2><p> When you open the box, you’ll find the Samsung CF591 curved monitor, the stand for the monitor, the power supply and adapter, an included HDMI cable, and documentation materials. You’ll need a Phillips or flat-head screwdriver to assemble the stand, but the setup process takes less than 10 minutes.</p><p> The monitor includes an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but if you want to connect via VGA or DP you’ll need to provide your own. There’s no USB port on the monitor either. The monitor itself is plug and play—connect the power supply and a cable to your tower or laptop. To assemble the stand, you use a screwdriver to screw the bottom two screws into the neck, and then slide the stand onto the monitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/14Ly_ys32O4szMDSlyOTtWSOH4I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4163673-4-3b8660ffba364bcabb2d095854005f4c.jpg"                      alt="Samsung CF591 Curved LED Monitor"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014849/22899" target="_top" id="2014849">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014849" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014849/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Vivid-color-good-contrast"><a href="#Image-Quality-Vivid-color-good-contrast" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Vivid color, good contrast"></a><strong>Image Quality: Vivid color, good contrast</strong></h2><p> Adding in FreeSync and a game mode doesn’t necessarily mean the peripheral is viable as a gaming monitor, but the C27F591 performs well with most PC and console titles. I noticed the slightest bit of color distortion on first-person shooters, but it was pretty mild. I also saw some ghosting with Mortal Kombat 11 and Forza Horizon 4 (that doesn’t typically occur on my Acer Predator XB1).</p><p> Overall, the monitor has a crisp and clear picture, in spite of its less than impressive max resolution of 1920 x 1080. The refresh rate of 60 Hz is fair, and the monitor’s 4-ms response time isn’t exactly head-turning. But this is a VA monitor, so I expected a slower response time. You can overclock it (up to about 72 Hz), and there are settings right within the OSD that let you adjust the response time (between standard, fast, or fastest), although cranking the setting up may be more trouble than it’s worth for most games because you may start to notice some latency. The VA panel has Freesync, so if you have a compatible (AMD) graphics card, this can help reduce the stuttering and screen tearing that can result when your graphics card is sending frames at a faster rate than your monitor can process.</p><p> The monitor has a crisp and clear picture, in spite of its less than impressive max resolution of 1920 x 1080.</p><p> The best-curved monitors have just enough curvature to enhance viewing angles, but not so much that it causes distortion. The C27F591 has a curvature of 1,800R. The curvature is subtle, yet present enough to provide those better viewing angles. With a 3000:1 contrast ratio and about 119 percent support of the RGB color gamut, the color is vibrant and the dark tones are surprisingly rich. It also has different brightness modes for viewing movies, basic use, or for enhancing contrast. There’s a game mode, which optimizes the settings for console and PC gaming, and you can also take advantage of settings like eco mode and eye saver mode.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934183/19272" target="_top" id="1934183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934183/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Better-than-most-monitors"><a href="#Audio-Better-than-most-monitors" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Better than most monitors"></a><strong>Audio: Better than most monitors</strong></h2><p> Samsung’s CF591 monitor has sufficient sound quality for both movies and gaming. The speakers are located on the back lower portion of the monitor, with one speaker on each side of the arm. With the dual five-watt stereo speakers built-in, the sound gets pretty loud, but it lacks fullness at louder volumes. The treble and mid-tones are distinct, but the bass is shallow. When you change the sound from the standard mode to music mode or movie mode, it enhances the bass slightly, but the bass isn’t punchy in any of the sound modes. On the plus side, speech comes through very clearly, and the speakers rival those in some of the best computer monitors in this price range. There’s also an audio jack for connecting an external speaker. You can connect a pair of headphones for gaming&#x2F;whenever you don’t want to disturb the people around you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fpQ3bucJ6PBbUNDMn9-c_NhKkp4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4163673-2-70dae79d29794b7699b1413d15361f1a.jpg"                      alt="Samsung CF591 Curved LED Monitor"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Software-Easy-splitting"><a href="#Software-Easy-splitting" class="headerlink" title="Software: Easy splitting"></a><strong>Software: Easy splitting</strong></h2><p> The incredibly clumsily named Easy Setting Box SW is downloadable screen-splitting software available for the CF591 that lets you arrange and rearrange your windows quickly and easily. You can choose a template indicating the manner in which you want your windows arranged, and when you open multiple windows, you’ll be able to see them all simultaneously. The software is pretty basic, but it does the job well, and it’s especially helpful if you’re using the monitor for work.</p><p> The CF591 serves well as a productivity monitor. If you typically use three screens at work, you can easily knock it down to two because of the large size and screen splitting allow you to manage more tasks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136545/16384" target="_top" id="2136545">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136545" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136545/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Reasonable-but-not-dirt-cheap"><a href="#Price-Reasonable-but-not-dirt-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable, but not dirt cheap"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable, but not dirt cheap</strong></h2><p> The Samsung C27F591 has been on the market for a few years now, so the price has dropped a bit since it was first released. We’ve seen the monitor on sale for between $220 and $270.</p><h2 id="Competition-A-curved-contender"><a href="#Competition-A-curved-contender" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A curved contender"></a><strong>Competition: A curved contender</strong></h2><p><strong>Acer ED3</strong> (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Widescreen-Monitor-Display-2560x1440/dp/B07MSK7VX7/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799266%7Cnbe6cafdf94964ddc82df3fff2e7a503e00%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <strong>):</strong> Acer’s ED3 monitors are also FreeSync compatible, and you can find an Acer ED3 monitor with similar pricing and specifications. Like the Samsung C27F591, the Acer ED273 monitor has a 27-inch display, 1920 x 1080 resolution, a 4-ms response time, and 178 degree horizontal and vertical viewing angles. While the ED273 has a faster refresh rate of 75 Hz, it only has 3-watt speakers (instead of 5-watt speakers like the Samsung C27F591). The Samsung C27F591 also has a more unique design than the Acer ED273.</p><p><strong>Samsung CF390</strong> (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-27-inch-Business-C27F390FHN-LED-Lit/dp/B01IPHVFUI/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799266%7Cnbe6cafdf94964ddc82df3fff2e7a503e00%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> )<strong>:</strong> Samsung’s CF390 monitor retails for under $200 for a 24-inch screen size, and it looks similar to the CF591 at first glance. It has the same resolution, curvature, response time, and viewing angles as the CF591. It even has a similar-looking stand. However, in addition to its smaller screen size, it also has a different color scheme, and the back has mounting holes.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The Samsung CF591 is an attractive monitor with a vibrant, curved display.</strong></p><p> The monitor’s response time and refresh rates leave something to be desired, but the addition of FreeSync helps ensure a tear-free, stutter-free picture. Overall, the CF591 performs well and provides a quality experience for those using the monitor for gaming, productivity, or everyday use.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  CF591</li><li>Product Brand  Samsung</li><li>SKU  5044701</li><li>Price  $269.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  24.18 x 10.64 x 18 in.</li><li>Warranty  One year</li><li>Compatibility  FreeSync</li><li>OS Compatibility  Mac, Windows</li><li>Screen Size  27 inches</li><li>Screen curvature  1800R</li><li>Screen Resolution  1920 x 1080</li><li>Aspect ratio  16:9</li><li>Refresh Rate  60 Hz</li><li>Horizontal viewing angle  178 degrees</li><li>Vertical viewing angle  178 degrees</li><li>Response Time  4 ms</li><li>Contrast ratio  3,000:1</li><li>Brightness  250 nits</li><li>Ports  HDMI, VGA, DisplayPort, Audio in, Headphone Out</li><li>Speakers  2 x 5-watt stereo speakers</li><li>Connectivity Options  HDMI, VGA, DP</li><li>Typical Power Consumption  36W</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/apple-imac-215-inch-4k-review-style-and-power/"><u>Apple iMac 21.5-Inch 4K Review: Style and Power</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/bose-frames-review/"><u>Bose Frames Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/building-an-empire-with-offworld-trading-co-an-in-depth-analysis-and-strategy-breakdown/"><u>Building an Empire with Offworld Trading Co.: An In-Depth Analysis and Strategy Breakdown</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/choosing-your-workhorse-email-how-does-outlookcom-stack-up-against-gmail/"><u>Choosing Your Workhorse Email: How Does Outlook.com Stack Up Against Gmail?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://network-issues.techidaily.com/direct3d-startup-obstacle-cleared-successful/"><u>Direct3D Startup Obstacle Cleared, Successful</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/fusion-of-video-and-melody-adding-music-to-vimeo-projects/"><u>Fusion of Video & Melody Adding Music to Vimeo Projects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-most-known-ways-to-find-someone-on-tinder-for-vivo-v30-pro-by-name-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 4 Most-Known Ways to Find Someone on Tinder For Vivo V30 Pro by Name | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-sharefake-location-on-whatsapp-for-tecno-camon-30-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Share/Fake Location on WhatsApp for Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-stream-anything-from-asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-to-apple-tv-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Stream Anything From Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate to Apple TV | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-unveiling-new-ways-to-record-presentations/"><u>In 2024, Unveiling New Ways to Record Presentations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/inside-obs-file-management-a-complete-explanation-of-recording-saves-locations/"><u>Inside OBS File Management: A Complete Explanation of Recording Saves Locations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/repair-damaged-unplayable-video-files-of-oppo-find-n3-flip-on-mac-by-stellar-video-repair-mobile-video-repair/"><u>Repair damaged, unplayable video files of Oppo Find N3 Flip on Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/top-picks-why-the-ring-video-doorbell-pro-stands-out-in-reviews/"><u>Top Picks: Why the Ring Video Doorbell Pro Stands Out in Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/ultimate-evaluation-of-the-2021-ipad-pro-with-m1-chip-top-notch-desktop-level-performance/"><u>Ultimate Evaluation of the 2021 iPad Pro with M1 Chip - Top Notch Desktop-Level Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/ultimate-evaluation-of-the-google-wireless-nest-doorbell-on-batteries/"><u>Ultimate Evaluation of the Google Wireless Nest Doorbell on Batteries</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> Although the core functionality is typically the same, laptop cooling pads come in a variety of designs and with different features. Some are robust and durable and may pack in additional perks, while some stick to the absolute basics, aiming to win out on pure bang for buck.</p><p> The TopMate C302 is a strong example of the latter. It’s affordable and solidly effective, but the plastic design feels a bit flimsy. I wouldn’t bet on it lasting for the long haul without gentle handling, but given the price, you might not worry about it too much.</p><h2 id="Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy"><a href="#Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Light and a little flimsy"></a>Design: Light and a little flimsy</h2><p> The C302 measures just over 14 inches wide and is designed for laptops with screens up to 15.6 inches diagonal. It’s primarily made of lightweight plastic, with a thin metal grate on the top above the two 4.9-inch fans to help dissipate heat.</p><p> The entire pad weighs only 1.1 pounds, but the downside to it being so lightweight is that it feels a bit flimsy and rickety. It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3qjwZzxQ2KVhmQJOdD2R9jBegvI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_03-ed7074949b6f4e4794ce30be2d582058.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1160850">                    <video width="576" height="324" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1160850">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1160850%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1160850/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> It has two little flip-up stopper nubs at the bottom to hold your laptop in place, and they can be gradually adjusted to avoid having them stick up and press into your wrists while typing. Meanwhile, a pair of feet on the bottom of the pad flip out to elevate your laptop about an inch upward to improve air circulation.</p><p> A single cable comes from the back of the pad to plug into a USB-A port on your computer, and it has a pass-through so that you can plug in another accessory, so as to not sacrifice a port simply to use the cooling pad. That’s handy.</p><p> It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p> The C302 has a little bit of accent lighting via a pair of blue lights beneath each fan, but it doesn’t emanate a significant glow, nor is it customizable in any way.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100538/7443" target="_top" id="2100538">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100538" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a>Setup Process: Plug and play</h2><p> The C302 is a purely plug-and-play accessory with no flashy perks or settings to deal with, nor any need for software on your computer. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the feet and holding nubs as desired, and plug the USB port into your computer to power on the pad. The fans will then activate and run at the only available speed, and you can unplug it when you’re done or don’t need it anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xhFp_B4P4BG8gb4dtJAGBbXPAlw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_05-4ce850d84f4a4e1d931588e23f39cb82.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Performance-It-makes-a-difference"><a href="#Performance-It-makes-a-difference" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It makes a difference"></a>Performance: It makes a difference</h2><p> I tested the C302 using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) gaming laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is equipped with an Intel Core i7-9750H processor and 16GB RAM, as well as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU (6GB).</p><p> This lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Across two recent, popular games and a graphics-intensive benchmark test, I first tested the laptop on its own and recorded the internal processor temperature using the NZXT CAM app, as well as the external temperature of the laptop using an infrared thermometer. After allowing the laptop to cool down, I repeated the process with the cooling pad in use.</p><p> In Fortnite, the Razer Blade 15 recorded a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees Fahrenheit and 118 degrees externally, while the cooling pad dropped those numbers to 179 degrees internal and 115 degrees external.</p><p> In Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade 15 hit 184 degrees internally and 117° externally, and those figures dropped to 175 degrees internally and 100 degrees externally with the cooling pad. There was no significant performance difference in the Dirt 5 benchmark when using the cooling pad: The average FPS mark was within one frame with or without the pad in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Xs71AyeThjZwy-vZJ9LfxIhuXJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_04-eadbaf270b874af9bb8843b95efe8ca7.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151869/7443" target="_top" id="2151869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Lastly, UNIGINE’s Heaven Benchmark hit 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees externally on the Razer Blade 15 alone, and dropped to 154 degrees internally and 105 degrees externally when using the C302. All told, this lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Depending on test, the results were roughly comparable to or better than more expensive cooling pads, like the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad and Thermaltake Massive TM, which have some added features onboard. It’s also pretty quiet in use—certainly quieter than the Razer Blade 15’s own internal fans.</p><h2 id="Price-It’s-very-affordable"><a href="#Price-It’s-very-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s very affordable"></a>Price: It’s very affordable</h2><p> At $30, this is one of the most affordable laptop cooling pads on the market right now. While results varied across multiple tests and games&#x2F;apps, the C302 was pretty well in line with some of the pricier options I tested. It feels a little flimsy and doesn’t have any premium features, but the C302 is a very good entry-level option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3hXx9Tb9omnQS0YyIXmv97Lunr0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_02-8fc1ac2169044c0a82b61a80f63ef089.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934142/19272" target="_top" id="1934142">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934142" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934142/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> At $27, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a bit more robust. It gives you the ability to power the fans on and off—either the one large fan, or the group of four smaller fans around it—plus it runs a little quieter in use. The unit feels more durable overall, although the Kootek’s height adjustment system feels clunky, as you slide a hanging metal bar into plastic ridges to keep it upright. Kootek’s pad is larger and designed for laptops as large at 17 inches, but if you don’t need the extra size, the TopMate C302 gets the job done for less cash.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An ideal entry-level pick.</strong></p><p> Durability questions aside, the TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad ultimately worked about as well as the other, pricier pads I tested, helping to offset some of the heat generated by a very hot gaming laptop. If you’re concerned about long-term damage or performance degradation from an overheating laptop, the C302 is a cost-efficient way to help keep your notebook from reaching extreme heat peaks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137207/26400" target="_top" id="2137207">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137207" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137207/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/north-face-pivoter-backpack-review-4690198" >North Face Pivoter Backpack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C302 Laptop Cooling Pad</li><li>Product Brand  TopMate</li><li>MPN  C302</li><li>Price  $30.99</li><li>Release Date  August 2016</li><li>Weight  1.09 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  14.2 x 10.43 x 1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Ports  USB-A</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-journey-into-the-future-of-video-clarity-in-depth-vce-22-review/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Journey Into the Future of Video Clarity - In-Depth VCE 2.2 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-vr-choices-pick-between-mobile-and-tethered-systems/"><u>[Updated] Navigating VR Choices Pick Between Mobile and Tethered Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/catchemall-celebrate-national-pokemon-day-with-virtual-location-on-oppo-reno-10-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>CatchEmAll Celebrate National Pokémon Day with Virtual Location On Oppo Reno 10 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/digital-documentation-mobile-and-desktop-meeting-recordings/"><u>Digital Documentation Mobile & Desktop Meeting Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-changefake-your-vivo-y27-5g-location-on-viber-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change/Fake Your Vivo Y27 5G Location on Viber | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-pivotal-vr-films-for-your-watchlist/"><u>In 2024, Pivotal VR Films for Your Watchlist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/is-the-netgear-c3000-modemrouter-a-relic-comparing-its-capabilities-to-modern-network-gear/"><u>Is The Netgear C3000 Modem/Router a Relic?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Most<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wifi-extenders-4043312" >Wi-Fi extenders <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are reasonably affordable devices that are pretty easy, straightforward ways to improve your existing home Wi-Fi situation. Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender takes on a different kind of philosophy. That’s reflected in the boosted price, certainly, but also the capabilities: this is the first Wi-Fi 6 extender on the market.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a new standard that not only allows for faster maximum speeds than previous generations but also better accommodates the increasing pile of wireless devices that we have around our homes and connecting at any given time—from phones to laptops and smart home gadgets. Newer smartphones and laptops are implementing support for the standard, and new Wi-Fi routers are being released to supply those benefits.</p><p> If you don’t already have one of those new Wi-Fi 6 routers, should you spend extra for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 to futureproof your setup? Here’s what I think after testing the device for several days across everyday web usage, media streaming, playing online games, and more.</p><h2 id="Design-Pretty-awkward"><a href="#Design-Pretty-awkward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Pretty awkward"></a><strong>Design: Pretty awkward</strong></h2><p> The Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is not only the largest and heaviest Wi-Fi extender I’ve tested at 10 inches tall and nearly two pounds, but it’s also one of the oddest-looking. It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward. Also, the little plastic feet don’t do a great job of supporting the weight, making it a bit wobbly on a flat surface.</p><p> With very large sides, the front is really just a small panel with light-up LED indicators showing connectivity details and which Ethernet ports are in use. There’s also a small WPS button beneath the LED panel for easy connectivity with a router. On the wider back panel are the four wired<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for plugging in devices such as game consoles and computers, as well as a USB 3.0 port, DC power port, and the power button itself.</p><p> It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037345/7443" target="_top" id="2037345">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037345" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037345/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app"><a href="#Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Avoid the app"></a><strong>Setup Process: Avoid the app</strong></h2><p> The setup options for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 are the same as with Netgear’s other extenders—even those without Wi-Fi 6 support. You’ll begin with the extender plugged in near your router. If your router supports<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wps-4842308" >WPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , then you can pair the extender with it easily by following the process listed in the included booklet, which is as simple as pressing a button on the router and then doing the same on the extender.</p><p> If that’s not an option, or you’d rather follow a step-by-step process with prompts, then you can set it up using either a mobile (iOS or Android) app or a web browser on your computer.</p><p> The mobile app has been unreliable in my experience with other Netgear extenders, but it was much worse when setting up the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The app repeatedly could not connect with the created mesh network on the extender during setup, and I had to factory reset the device multiple times to start again.</p><p> Over and over, the setup process wouldn’t complete… and then it finally did. I ran into similar issues with the other Netgear extenders, in which setup processes didn’t work as expected on the first or second time, but this was a much longer and more arduous ordeal. Finally, however, I got the Nighthawk AX8 up and running. From there, you’ll need to find a new location for the extender—roughly halfway between the router and your Wi-Fi dead zone is ideal, but play around with positioning if you’re not getting the results you seek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xru8JLL_UOk3sXBYpbrOyAl-ihc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_02-b120eab8816746338c53e4eb1cfc62d6.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884017/19272" target="_top" id="1884017">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884017" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884017/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Smooth-sailing"><a href="#Connectivity-Smooth-sailing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Smooth sailing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Smooth sailing</strong></h2><p> Once through the hassle of setup, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender really did deliver strong performance. I tested the connection in my office, which reliably sees reduced 5GHz reception from my router due to obstructions in between, and saw a noticeable boost in both reception and speed.</p><p> In one test, I registered a 5GHz speed of 246Mbps with the extender, which was the fastest wireless speed I’ve seen anywhere in my house using that older, TP-Link router. Given that, I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The router isn’t Wi-Fi 6 compatible, but I still saw higher top-end speeds than ever before.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender also performed pretty well in distance testing. In another instance, I registered a 5GHz download speed of 87Mbps with my office, and then measured the speeds from my backyard at approximate distance intervals from the extender.</p><p> I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8.</p><p> That 5GHz signal dropped down to 77Mbps at 25 feet, 74Mbps at 50 feet, and 56Mbps at 25 feet—still pretty speedy from the farthest edge of my property. Meanwhile, the 2.4GHz signal started at just 42Mbps at that moment in my office, and dropped to 30Mbps at 25 feet, 28Mbps at 50 feet, and 26Mbps at 75 feet.</p><p> Given the high max speeds, it wasn’t surprising to see strong gaming performance, as well. While playing Rocket League, I saw smooth gameplay across the wired Ethernet connection as well as both wireless networks, with a ping as low as 33 via the wired connection. The wireless ping was only a few points higher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rtnI3hSe9qP5qFqjhu1LRxe7qYY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_03-19da5fea4d0349ce984f52a11493d337.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> As a Wi-Fi mesh extender, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 will automatically replicate the SSID of your router’s existing Wi-Fi networks and seamlessly keep you connected whenever you’re in range of either. That’s true even with non-Netgear routers and those without Wi-Fi 6 support, and it’s a huge benefit over some cheaper extenders that don’t keep the same network info intact across devices.</p><p> It’s billed as an “8-stream” device, so it should be able to handle several simultaneous media streams at once, with a billed max speed of 4.8Gbps on the 5GHz band and 1.2Gbps on the 2.4GHz band. It has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >MU-MIMO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (multiple users, multi-in multi-out) and beamforming capabilities, promising expanded range of up to 2,500 square feet and support for 30+ simultaneous devices.</p><p> If you don’t have a Wi-Fi 6 router, then you’ll either want to start there or consider investing in a Wi-Fi mesh system instead.</p><h2 id="Price-More-than-most"><a href="#Price-More-than-most" class="headerlink" title="Price: More than most"></a><strong>Price: More than most</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is listed at $250, although it’s being sold for $220 at multiple retailers as of this writing. That’s definitely on the higher end for an extender.</p><p> Should you really spend that much on an extender? If you don’t already have a new Wi-Fi 6 router, then probably not. You might see higher peaks of speed as I did, but rather than trying to mix and match old and new tech, you’re probably better off investing in a new Wi-Fi mesh system that can cover the entire house. Netgear’s Orbi is a favorite, as is Google’s similar Nest Wi-Fi system.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896560/19272" target="_top" id="1896560">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896560" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896560/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)</strong></h2><p> Both of these Netgear Nighthawk Wi-Fi extenders will set you back $200 or more, and the key difference between them—aside from design—is the Wi-Fi 6 compatibility of the Nighthawk AX8. The Nighthawk X6S (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Wi-Fi-Range-Extender-EX8000/dp/B074F3M2W8/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846125%7Cn35b11b2c61b54fa1a2d951691d1a61ed04%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) doesn’t have that, but it does deliver excellent 5GHz range and has four Gigabit Ethernet ports for wired devices.

On the other hand, Google offers Android software to many phone makers, including Samsung, HTC, and Motorola. Because of that, Android phones vary in size, weight, features, and quality.</p><p> Premium-priced Android phones are about as good as the iPhone, but a cheaper Android device with fewer features may be all you need.</p><p> If you’re buying an iPhone, you need to pick a model. Because many companies make Android devices, you must choose a brand and a model. Some may prefer the choice, but others appreciate Apple’s greater simplicity and higher quality.</p><h2 id="Operating-Systems-Both-Have-Benefits"><a href="#Operating-Systems-Both-Have-Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Operating Systems: Both Have Benefits"></a>Operating Systems: Both Have Benefits</h2><p> iPhone</p><ul><li>Runs on Apple’s iOS.</li><li>New versions launch annually.</li></ul><p> Android</p><ul><li>Runs on Android, with some manufacturers using a slightly different version.</li><li>Android may update less regularly.</li></ul><p> Android phones run on Google’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-android-1616887" >Android operating system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , while iPhones use Apple’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ios-1994355" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In general, they work the same: You’ll have a home screen with your most popular apps, including games and utilities, a phone app to make calls, a camera app for pictures, and a messaging app to send texts. They also use touch interfaces, including hardware like accelerometers or gyroscopes, for more functions.</p><p> Apple releases a new version of iOS about every fall, with additional updates throughout the year. In the earlier days of Android, updates were less frequent and regular (Android 2.0 came out in 2009, while both 3 and 4 came out in 2011). Recently, however, Android has fallen more into an annual update cycle. Some Android device makers, like Samsung,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-samsung-one-ui-4178405" >use a slightly modified <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> operating system version.</p><p> Some Android makers are slow to update their phones to the latest<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/android-versions-4173277" >version of the Android OS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and sometimes don’t update their phones. Apple typically supports phones for five or six years old, Samsung supports phones for around four years, and Google supports the latest Pixels for seven years.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/play-pc-games-on-iphone-8559383" >How to Play PC Games on iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134500/19576" target="_top" id="2134500">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134500" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134500/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Apps-Android-Has-More-Options"><a href="#Apps-Android-Has-More-Options" class="headerlink" title="Apps: Android Has More Options"></a>Apps: Android Has More Options</h2><p> iPhone</p><ul><li>Only available through Apple’s App Store (others are supported in the EU).</li><li>Around 2 million apps.</li></ul><p> Android</p><ul><li>Available in the Google Play Store and through third-party sources.</li><li>Around 3 million apps.</li></ul><p> The Apple App Store offers fewer apps than Google Play, but we’re still talking_millions_ of apps, and the selection isn’t the most crucial factor.</p><p> Apple is strict about what apps it allows, while Google’s standards for Android are more relaxed. Apple’s tighter control is part of why its app store has fewer offerings than Google’s, which means you’re less likely to download malware.</p><p> The other benefit of Apple’s centralized storefront is that the company is sure that everything in there is compatible with the available devices. The combination of multiple manufacturers of Android phones and less screening in the Google Play Store means that you may not be sure that an app you want will work with your particular phone.</p><p> That aside, the higher selection and ability to download Android apps outside the official Google Play Store may appeal to some users.</p><h2 id="Price-iPhones-Are-Generally-More-Expensive-Androids-Have-a-Wider-Range-of-Affordability"><a href="#Price-iPhones-Are-Generally-More-Expensive-Androids-Have-a-Wider-Range-of-Affordability" class="headerlink" title="Price: iPhones Are Generally More Expensive; Androids Have a Wider Range of Affordability"></a>Price: iPhones Are Generally More Expensive; Androids Have a Wider Range of Affordability</h2><p> iPhone</p><ul><li>General range: $500 - $1,500+</li></ul><p> Android</p><ul><li>General range: $100 - $1,700+</li></ul><p> Apple positioned the iPhone as a premium device, and the price reflects that. You won’t find a new one for less than $500. Meanwhile, Android-compatible phones are available at a huge range of prices, from around $100 to 20 times that amount.</p><p> While it’s possible to get an Android phone for cheaper, you may get what you pay for. High-end Samsung devices can cost as much or even more than an iPhone if you want a new Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel. At this end of the range, there’s little difference in quality between Android and iPhone. A cheaper Android may be fine if you don’t need a high-tech camera or other features.  </p><p> However, the wide availability of payment plans from Apple, Google, and retailers means you can quickly get an upper-tier phone by paying monthly instead of all at once. These options make price less of an issue.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-or-samsung-which-should-you-buy-4684088" >iPhone vs. Samsung Phone: Which One Should You Buy? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1160850">                    <video width="576" height="324" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1160850">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1160850%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1160850/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Security-Apple-Keeps-It-Locked-Down"><a href="#Security-Apple-Keeps-It-Locked-Down" class="headerlink" title="Security: Apple Keeps It Locked Down"></a>Security: Apple Keeps It Locked Down</h2><p> iPhone</p><ul><li>Encrypted end-to-end.</li><li>App Store designed to prevent malware.</li></ul><p> Android</p><ul><li>Encrypted end-to-end.</li><li>Wider third-party app availability can open a device to malware.</li></ul><p> If you care about the security of your smartphone, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/reasons-iphone-is-more-secure-than-android-2000308" >iPhone is more secure than the Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The main reason is the operating system’s design.</p><p> Apple controls downloads. One of the most common ways to compromise digital security is by downloading malware – software designed to steal information or affect how a device works.</p><p> Apple works to prevent malware from appearing on its App Store, which is the primary way to get iPhone apps and the_only_ way if you’re not in the EU. In this way, Android’s openness and flexibility can become a liability.</p><p> However, it’s important to note that the iPhone isn’t immune to security threats; it’s less likely to be targeted than Android-based phones.  </p><h2 id="Intelligent-Assistant-Google-Assistant-Beats-Siri"><a href="#Intelligent-Assistant-Google-Assistant-Beats-Siri" class="headerlink" title="Intelligent Assistant: Google Assistant Beats Siri"></a>Intelligent Assistant: Google Assistant Beats Siri</h2><p> iPhone</p><ul><li>Default platform: Siri.</li><li>iPhones can use Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa through apps.</li></ul><p> Android</p><ul><li>Default platforms: Google Assistant or Samsung Bixby.</li><li>Android users can’t use Siri.</li></ul><p> Artificial intelligence and voice interfaces will drive the next frontier of smartphone functionality.

Because Apple makes computers, tablets, watches, and the iPhone, it provides features that Android may not.</p><p> For example, you can use your iPhone as a remote for your Apple TV. You can also unlock your iPhone or MacBook with an Apple Watch. AirDrop lets you instantly transfer files and links between an iPhone, Mac, or iPad without creating an email.</p><p> Other continuity features let you start a YouTube video on Apple TV and pick it up where you left off on the iPhone. AirPlay can let you share your Mac’s screen with an Apple TV or use an iPad as a second monitor.</p><p> Google’s services, like Gmail, Maps, etc., work across all Android devices. But unless your watch, tablet, phone, and computer are all made by the same company—and there aren’t too many companies other than Samsung that make products in all of those categories—Android has no unified cross-device experience.  </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139109/17108" target="_top" id="2139109">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139109" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139109/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Serviceability-Get-Android-for-DIY-Fixes"><a href="#Serviceability-Get-Android-for-DIY-Fixes" class="headerlink" title="Serviceability: Get Android for DIY Fixes"></a>Serviceability: Get Android for DIY Fixes</h2><p> iPhone</p><ul><li>Self-repair is difficult, if not impossible.</li><li>You’ll need to take your device to a service provider or Apple Store.</li></ul><p> Android</p><ul><li>Many manufacturers make their devices user-serviceable.</li></ul><p> Apple emphasizes elegance and simplicity in the iPhone above all else.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> A dash cam is not your typical camera, but rather one you never want to have to use, because if you do need to use it something has likely gone terribly wrong. At least with the Pruveeo F5 FHD 1080P Dash Cam you don’t have to spend much more than pocket change for the security that a backup cam provides.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Design-Nostalgia-trip"><a href="#Design-Nostalgia-trip" class="headerlink" title="Design: Nostalgia trip"></a><strong>Design: Nostalgia trip</strong></h2><p> The Pruveeo F5 gives the immediate impression that it was constructed some time in the previous decade. Anyone who bought a bargain bin MP3 player from the aughts will instantly recognize the cheap plastic shell, the glossy, chintzy buttons, and a screen that screams early 21st century in big neon letters.</p><p> Despite their antiquated design, the buttons are easy to operate, though their function is somewhat obtuse. The screen is truly tiny at just 1.5 inches, and very difficult to use, which paired with the subpar quality of the controls means navigating the on screen menu system is a pain. The screen’s also very prone to picking up scratches, dirt, and fingerprints.</p><p> The inclusion of a worse-than-useless audio port is bizarre and inexplicable.</p><p> Power is provided via an accessory socket adapter that plugs into the camera via a mini USB port that can also be used to transfer files. However, you’ll need to purchase a different mini USB cable for file transfer as the included cable is permanently affixed to the charger. You can run the camera off the built-in battery for a short time, but it’s only intended for emergencies and will only last a few minutes before the charge is depleted.</p><p> The camera angle can be adjusted by turning a small knob, but only very slightly, and the mechanism is difficult to operate. Also included is a cable management extension to the main body of the device which nearly doubles it in length. It seems unnecessary, as there’s only one cable and it’s not difficult to manage. Perhaps it’s to make the device look like part of the car by extending it up to the trim where you are presumably meant to route the cable around to your accessory port. We found it more convenient to just let the cable dangle straight down, which is less aesthetically pleasing but much more convenient and less difficult to install.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Simple-but-poorly-described"><a href="#Setup-Process-Simple-but-poorly-described" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Simple, but poorly described"></a><strong>Setup Process:</strong> <strong>Simple, but poorly described</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Pruveeo F5 may not be a particularly complicated process, but it is complicated by the fact that the instruction manual doesn’t really tell you anything about the installation process. You’re mostly left to figure it out on your own.</p><p> Start by inserting the microSD card (class 10 is recommended), then stick the corresponding adhesive pads to the mounts and then the window. We found it very difficult to perfectly align the camera, but due to the very wide field of view it doesn’t need to be exactly right. We also only found it necessary to install one of the two adhesive pads, as the second is only for the cable management add on. The camera can be clipped and unclipped from the adhesive mounts for file transfer to a computer.</p><p> As mentioned, you can hide the cable along the edge of your windshield, but this is difficult to do and you risk damaging your interior. If you’re not up for this you can simply let the cable dangle, which we found most convenient.</p><p> Lastly, you just need to set the time and date, format your memory card, and you should be good to go. Those unfamiliar with cameras and other electronics may find the lack of adequate instructions frustrating and a real obstacle while installing and operating this device.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Extremely-poor"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Extremely-poor" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Extremely poor"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Extremely poor</strong></h2><p> Every issue associated with a cheap camera is magnified in the Pruveeo F5. It’s actually hard to know where to begin when describing the serious problems present in the footage this dash cam produces. Artifacting, noise, poor color, and a mushy, unclear appearance make reviewing the video from the Pruveeo F5 an almost painful experience. You won’t be using this to film your vacation.</p><p> Every issue associated with a cheap camera is magnified in the Pruveeo F5.</p><p> However, it’s important to realize that this is not what the Pruveeo F5 is built for, and that this is a tool more akin to a black box on an airplane than a traditional camera. It is more well suited for this purpose, if only slightly. The field of view ahead is wide enough, and you can tell roughly what is going on in the video, and even read license plates if they are close enough (a couple of feet). Though this camera is indeed terrible, it does its essential job, albeit at the most basic possible level. Surprisingly, it does not become so much worse while driving in low light conditions—perhaps because a camera can only be so bad.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139109/17108" target="_top" id="2139109">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139109" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139109/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Lackluster-and-very-basic"><a href="#Performance-Lackluster-and-very-basic" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Lackluster and very basic"></a><strong>Performance: Lackluster and very basic</strong></h2><p> The F5 records video and audio poorly but reliably, and you can loop video so that old video is erased as new video is recorded, and lock important video clips to keep them from being erased by accident. Unlike other dash cams, this locking function must be triggered manually with a button press rather than automatically by collision sensors.</p><p> For some reason there’s also an audio jack, which is unmarked and unmentioned in the manual. You might think that this is meant for headphones, so that you can listen to videos you have recorded, but under no circumstances should you try to do this—not only will audio play through the speakers and not through your headphones, but as we found, an extremely loud buzzing noise will blast from the headphones. The inclusion of this worse-than-useless port is bizarre and inexplicable.</p><p> As Wi-Fi is not available, you have two options for transferring footage to other devices. You can either use a USB cable to plug the camera into a computer, or you can remove the microSD card and insert it directly into your computer.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918666/19272" target="_top" id="1918666">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918666" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918666/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-and-software-Mysteriously-absent"><a href="#Connectivity-and-software-Mysteriously-absent" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity and software: Mysteriously absent"></a><strong>Connectivity and software: Mysteriously absent</strong></h2><p> You will find in your instructions information on using Wi-Fi and a mobile app. However, as pointed out on Pruveeo’s Amazon storefront and on Pruveeo’s website, the feature has been removed from the F5. This is not a death blow to the camera, but it severely limits its appeal compared to competing products. Without Wi-Fi and the companion app (GoPlus Cam), you can’t use the various features this enables. You can’t use your phone to remotely control the Pruveeo F5, use it as a viewfinder, download files to your phone, or change settings using a less frustrating interface than that built into the camera.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123749/7443" target="_top" id="2123749">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123749" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123749/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Cheap-if-below-MSRP"><a href="#Price-Cheap-if-below-MSRP" class="headerlink" title="Price: Cheap if below MSRP"></a><strong>Price: Cheap if below MSRP</strong></h2><p> At its MSRP of $70 the Pruveeo F5 faces stiff competition, but fortunately it typically retails for about half that price, and in the $30-$50 range its a bargain.

Keep in mind that you must consider the price of a microSD card in the total cost, as one is necessary but not included.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997690/19272" target="_top" id="1997690">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997690" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997690/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Pruveeo-F5-vs-Anker-Roav-C1"><a href="#Pruveeo-F5-vs-Anker-Roav-C1" class="headerlink" title="Pruveeo F5 vs. Anker Roav C1"></a><strong>Pruveeo F5 vs. Anker Roav C1</strong></h2><p> The Anker Roav C1 offers far superior build quality, Wi-Fi connectivity, and a much better screen than the Pruveeo F5 at a similar MSRP. However, the Pruveeo F5 can be found for steeper discounts, and often retails for about half the price of the Anker C1. That’s cheap enough that the many deficiencies of the Pruveeo F5 can be forgiven to some extent. Even with such a price difference we would still recommend the Anker C1 as a better value given the glut of flaws in quality and performance hamstringing the F5.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/anker-roav-dashcam-c1-review-4773139" >Anker Roav DashCam C1 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Difficult to recommend.</strong></p><p> The only reason not to completely write off the Pruveeo F5 as hot garbage is how frequently it’s on sale, but enough at a discount it’s not a great product. It’s only barely possible, given its limited capabilities, to use this as an aid for insurance claims in case of accidents. For all its faults we did find it to be reliable, and the video it captures marginally acceptable for its purpose, but there are so many better options available for slightly more money.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  F5 FHD 1080P Dash Cam</li><li>Product Brand  Pruveeo</li><li>UPC  B01MQVYT8E</li><li>Price  $70.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.9 x 1.7 x 1.5 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Recording Quality  FHD 1080P</li><li>Night vision  Low light sensitivity</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-streamlining-your-approach-to-configuring-and-gauging-fb-instream-ads/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Streamlining Your Approach to Configuring & Gauging FB Instream Ads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-close-up-views-on-web-conferencing/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering Close-Up Views on Web Conferencing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/aughters-legacy-the-process-of-parody-film-making-for-2024/"><u>[New] Laughter's Legacy The Process of Parody Film-Making for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-fb-activity-preview-insight-or-intrusion-whats-safer/"><u>[Updated] FB Activity Preview Insight or Intrusion – What's Safer?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-the-art-of-deleting-discord-servers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering the Art of Deleting Discord Servers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-pro-cameras-who-wins-gopro-and-garmin-virb-comparison-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Pro Cameras, Who Wins?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus is an interesting proposition. For only $50, it promises to provide heart rate monitoring, music storage, call management, voice control, and remote notifications. For the most part, it delivers. The Bitwatch has its share of design flaws, such as a poorly fitted watch strap and an iOS-only voice app, but it performs enough to be a reasonable consideration for those looking for their first smartwatch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8rMhc1Lk5yFRFW4Zlt2K9cmPdFo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4157747-4-01d7e5ff51aa47008d803513064f4a7a.jpg"                      alt="Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus Smartwatch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Design-and-Software-A-surprising-amount-of-features-in-this-chunky-watch"><a href="#Design-and-Software-A-surprising-amount-of-features-in-this-chunky-watch" class="headerlink" title="Design and Software: A surprising amount of features in this chunky watch"></a><strong>Design and Software: A surprising amount of features in this chunky watch</strong></h2><p> The most outstanding feature of the Bitwatch’s design is its chunkiness. For those with small wrists, this smartwatch looks ridiculous. Furthermore, the included bands are too small in comparison to the watch, giving the overall design a cheap feel. When you wear this watch, you will notice it weighing your wrists down, taunting you to take it off. But as ugly as the Bitwatch is, it is a functional little watch. It has a power button and volume buttons, as well as a strong vibration motor. Its touchscreen works without a problem, and the app layout is intuitive to understand.</p><p> The 2-inch IPS panel is bright and easy to read, although not the highest resolution (240 x 240). When you scroll through the Bitwatch’s apps, it’s apparent that it heavily favors Apple devices: there is a Siri app integration, but this will not work with Android devices. Its other apps are a phonebook, call log, dialer, messaging, remote notifier, “anti-theft” (Find My Phone), alarm, calendar, music storage and playback, remote capture, pedometer, sleep monitor, sedentary reminder, heart rate monitor, sound recorder, stopwatch, and calculator. It’s a fairly thorough collection of applications for a watch that doesn’t support third-party apps.</p><p> The 2-inch IPS panel is bright and easy to read, although not the highest resolution (240 x 240).</p><p> While it doesn’t have<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nfc-832715" >NFC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or GPS, it does have a speaker, and you can send basic messages with the watch. The Bitwatch S1 is surprisingly robust for those who want to dip their toes into the smartwatch experience, with many of the features that mid-tier smartwatches possess.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-but-unexplained"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-but-unexplained" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy, but unexplained"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy, but unexplained</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Bitwatch works as you’d expect. Pair it via the Bluetooth on your phone and download the Beantech app. It works with both Android and iOS, so you should have no difficulty. Alerts will show up in the remote notifier app, and apps such as the calendar are not synced with your phone’s calendar apps, so keep that in mind if you’d like to add any events, notifications, or alarms to your watch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O7xHfA9sKsBdC0nmqNXbFky-Dm4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4157747-2-3b838f1124184bbd9452b79bb8449c2b.jpg"                      alt="Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus Smartwatch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014859/22899" target="_top" id="2014859">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014859" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014859/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Performance-You-get-what-you-pay-for"><a href="#Performance-You-get-what-you-pay-for" class="headerlink" title="Performance: You get what you pay for"></a><strong>Performance: You get what you pay for</strong></h2><p> The Bitwatch’s low price tag shows in its performance, unfortunately. The Siri app is just that: it interfaces with Siri, meaning that voice commands are iOS-exclusive. Notification handling on the device can get confusing also. You find notifications in the Remote Notifier app, and dismissing them on the Bitwatch does not dismiss them on your phone.</p><p> You get reliable notifications and a passable heart rate monitor, as well as some basic functions like alarms and a speaker.</p><p> However, notifications do sync almost instantly from your phone to the Bitwatch, and its heart rate monitor is fairly accurate when measuring a resting heart rate. The pedometer isn’t the best thought, often falling within a range of a hundred steps of the true value.</p><p> If you’d like to listen to calls or music through the speaker, you will miss a lot of information— think of those jingles they play when you’re on hold for a phone call. At least the screen is big and easy to read, and the notifications_do_ work. It’s good enough for someone that wants to get a feel to a smartwatch experience, but there are better options for a little more money if you can afford it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7GtX2IU-w4sJA-BTqQtHQThxaJo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4157747-3-ade31135cd9d4fe0b6b01286941d2652.jpg"                      alt="Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus Smartwatch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993647">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993647%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Battery-It-last-longer-than-most-flagship-smartwatches"><a href="#Battery-It-last-longer-than-most-flagship-smartwatches" class="headerlink" title="Battery: It last longer than most flagship smartwatches"></a><strong>Battery: It last longer than most flagship smartwatches</strong></h2><p> The battery life on the Bitwatch is excellent. With regular usage (GPS, heart rate, Bluetooth all on), we got between two and three days of use before we had to recharge. Charging is a little annoying, though, since it uses a snapping charger base that’s difficult to remove.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886019/19272" target="_top" id="1886019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886019/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Reasonable-but-worth-paying-more"><a href="#Price-Reasonable-but-worth-paying-more" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable, but worth paying more"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable, but worth paying more</strong></h2><p> The Bitwatch costs about $50, which is reasonable for its features and performance. You get reliable notifications and a passable heart rate monitor, as well as some basic functions like alarms and a speaker. If you want a cheap smartwatch, then the Bitwatch isn’t a bad pick, but $30 more can get you GPS and smarter notifications.

However, it suffers in reliability and style, which may turn users off from the smartwatch market altogether. For a little more money, you can get the Amazfit Bip_,_ a sleek smartwatch from Huami that has a thirty-day battery life, fitness tracking, onboard GPS, and notifications. If you’re looking to get something very cheap to try out the smartwatch lifestyle, you should also look at the Padgene DZ09 Smart Watch, which is only $15 and has a lot of the features on the Bitwatch.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazfit-bip-review-4773112" >Amazfit Bip Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An ultra-budget smartwatch that covers the basics.</strong></p><p> The Beantech Bitwatch is not a groundbreaking smartwatch, but it provides a lot of essential features for $50.

I tested the attractive Antop AT-127 Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a worthy option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997657/19272" target="_top" id="1997657">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997657" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997657/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Reversible-faux-wood-finish"><a href="#Design-Reversible-faux-wood-finish" class="headerlink" title="Design: Reversible faux wood finish"></a><strong>Design: Reversible faux wood finish</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 is one of the better-looking antennas I’ve come across. It’s a thin, plastic rectangular antenna that measures 13 inches wide by nine inches tall. At 0.02 inches in thickness, it’s almost paper-thin, but the plastic feels sturdy enough to withstand regular wear and tear.</p><p> The antenna is reversible, with a light oak finish on one side, and darker wood color on the other. It looks less like an eyesore or something you need to hide, and more like an attractive component, you’re willing to display. The pre-attached coaxial cable comes out of the bottom, which is ideal. You can’t remove the cable from the antenna, which isn’t great for storage, but it does promote stable connectivity.</p><p> The antenna comes with a stand for placement on a desk or entertainment center. It also comes with double-sided adhesives, so you can hang it on a wall or window. The adhesives are extremely sticky—when I pulled the antenna off of my wall, the paint came off along with it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RWXekalxAMy_w61EH_Getqbfiy0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Antop-AT-127-TV-Antenna-2-24f94c63d6164dc7a54542cc1e4262c9.jpg"                      alt="Antop AT-127"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Setup-Easier-than-most"><a href="#Setup-Easier-than-most" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Easier than most"></a><strong>Setup: Easier than most</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is relatively intuitive. You just connect the antenna to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connection on your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The antenna has an easy-push connector, instead of a connector you have to twist onto the threading. This makes for easier setup because you don’t have to struggle behind your TV with trying to screw on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/coaxial-vs-optical-digital-cable-3134605" >coaxial cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Once you connect the antenna’s cable to your TV, you’ll need to find the best placement. This is perhaps the most difficult part of the setup process. My test home is in a wooded area, and I found the best placement was near or directly on the window. However,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >to improve your antenna’s reception <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it’s usually a good idea to place the antenna high up in a room close to the home’s exterior (and nearest to the transmitter towers) and to avoid obstacles like walls and tree cover.</p><p> The antenna has an easy-push connector, instead of a connector you have to screw onto the coax threading.</p><h2 id="Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels"><a href="#Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Almost two dozen channels"></a><strong>Performance: Almost two dozen channels</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 supports UHF and VHF signals. Overall, it works pretty smoothly, though some channels might have look pixelated for a few seconds when you flip to them or take a second or two to fully load.</p><p> The attached coax cable isn’t as long as I’ve seen on other similarly-priced antennas, but it is long enough (10 feet) to place the antenna up high without an extender.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5o1YIUg5PeQto5h_Mm6uuK9o5JQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Antop-AT-127-TV-Antenna-3-7f7ec909a6b944cabe60862b51a6ba2b.jpg"                      alt="Antop AT-127"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Range-Could-be-better"><a href="#Range-Could-be-better" class="headerlink" title="Range: Could be better"></a><strong>Range: Could be better</strong></h2><p> My test home is in a rural area, and there’s a lot of tree cover on the property. The omnidirectional Antop AT-127 has a 40-mile range, which was enough to pick up local channels from neighboring cities.</p><p> On my first attempt, I used the included stand, and the auto-programming only picked up four channels. When I placed the antenna on a window facing the TV transmitter tower, however, the omnidirectional HD antenna picked up 23 channels, which is a good amount considering the area.</p><p> The omnidirectional Antop AT-127 has a 40-mile range, enough to pick up local channels from neighboring cities.</p><h2 id="Price-Mid-range"><a href="#Price-Mid-range" class="headerlink" title="Price: Mid-range"></a><strong>Price: Mid-range</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 retails for $35, which is middle of the road for an indoor TV antenna with the Antop’s specs. Some 50-mile (or longer) range antennas sell for as little as $20 or as much as $100, but the cheaper antennas usually don’t look as nice as the AT-127.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Gyp2hHNkH22HeYhnm37WRKC_MHU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Antop-AT-127-TV-Antenna-4-baa9b55de12c4a91aa6baad4c8d86272.jpg"                      alt="Antop AT-127"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036486/19272" target="_top" id="2036486">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036486" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036486/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Antop-AT-127-vs-AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna"><a href="#Antop-AT-127-vs-AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="Antop AT-127 vs. AmazonBasics Flat TV Antenna"></a><strong>Antop AT-127 vs. AmazonBasics Flat TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> You can find indoor antennas for less than $15 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075ZQXB26/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4845583%7Cna0f30cabffec4337b279a8df3e4c99b015%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).

No, it wasn’t the most powerful headset out there, using a two-year-old smartphone processor to power its games and experiences, but it was a capable, completely self-contained, wireless VR headset that didn’t require a PC or game console to deliver stellar immersion.</p><p> It was one of last year’s greatest new gadgets, and now Oculus has returned with a sequel. The Oculus Quest 2 is smaller and lighter, yet more powerful and with a much better screen—yet it costs $100 less than the original. How did that happen? Well, it’s not all great news, thanks to a couple of cost-cutting measures that you’ll feel and potentially see, but the end result is ultimately a better and more affordable device that serves as an ideal gateway into VR.</p><h2 id="Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made"><a href="#Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made" class="headerlink" title="Design and Comfort: Compromises were made"></a>Design and Comfort: Compromises were made</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 sticks to the familiar modern VR playbook as a module that you strap onto your face to immerse yourself within its digital worlds but features some different material and construction choices than the original. Unfortunately, the design choices largely are not upgrades compared to the original headset</p><p> Noticeably, the module itself doesn’t jut out as far from your face as before, plus it has a white plastic finish rather than the black fabric-lined exterior of the original. It also weighs less, which is a good thing for a device that hangs off of your face: it comes in at 503g compared to 571g with the original Quest.</p><p> However, the shallower depth of the module makes an impact for someone like me who must wear glasses while using the Quest 2.</p><p> Even with the included, optional glasses spacer, which adds a couple extra millimeters between the lenses and where the padded visor presses against your face, the inside felt much tighter against my glasses. It can be tricky to get the Quest 2 on without my eyelashes brushing against my lenses.</p><p> But that’s also due in part to the new fabric strap system, which is less effective than the rubber, dome-like strap from the first Quest. That previous strap did a better job of cupping the back of your head to offset the weight of the module itself and keep it comfortably strapped to your head, but these loose, adjustable fabric straps aren’t nearly as secure. It took me longer to get the headset on and in a comfortable position, and I couldn’t find the same kind of sweet spot as before.</p><p> Oculus now sells a $49 Elite Strap attachment that’s more akin to the original Quest strap, and while the Quest 2 straps are usable, I’ll probably make the upgrade and buy the better strap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JkgQv_Sk0ofSL0Sp-jKmqe84xak=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-2-a7792535288542dba45c8bc32f882be2.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Rift 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks"><a href="#Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks"></a>Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 uses the same kind of “inside-out” tracking system that relies on four cameras on the visor to track the wireless controllers or even your hands, rather than relying on external tracking sensors as some PC-based systems do. Like the original, it works amazingly well, allowing for fluid, six-degrees-of-freedom movement in games and minimizing both initial setup and the time it takes to get going each session. It also means that you can use the Oculus Quest 2_anywhere_ without the need for any kind of external hardware or accessories.</p><p> The Quest 2’s wireless, motion-sensing Oculus Touch controllers are identical in function to the original, but are a little heavier and have a larger surface with space to rest your thumb when not in use. That’s handy. Each has an analog stick and two face buttons, along with a trigger button and a grip button. Oculus also swapped out the magnetically-attached battery doors from the first Quest controllers—which would sometimes slide open when I used the original—for ones that simply click into place. That’s a win for function over form.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1aG6kdNHMuvnim8p8_i1RwH9QG8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-3-eec6cabc11db4ed9be5254aa2bc46ec1.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123737/7443" target="_top" id="2123737">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123737" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123737/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> But there is a potential loss for function and comfort with one other particular aspect of the headset itself: IPD adjustment. Inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is the physical distance between your eyes, and a headset must account for it to effectively deliver clear, 3D experiences. On the original Quest, a physical slider let you precisely adjust the distance to match your own face. With the Quest 2, however, there are just three settings, and you can physically shift the placement of the lenses to choose the position that is closest to your own.</p><p> If your IPD matches or is very close to one of the settings (58mm, 63mm, 68mm), then you’re all set. If not, then you may notice that the image isn’t as clear as you’d like, and it could potentially lead to headaches if you can’t find a pretty good sweet spot. In my case, my IPD is close enough to the middle setting to be OK, but it doesn’t feel as spot-on as it did on the original Quest using the slider. It might help knock down the price of the headset, but that’s a quality-of-life downgrade that will affect some people significantly more than others.</p><p> That might sound like a lot of griping, but it’s only because some of the key physical design changes on the Quest 2 feel like compromises or downgrades. But for most people, they won’t be significant impediments. And if you’re coming to the new headset without ever using the original Quest, then you should be fine—the new straps are usable, but they aren’t as effective or effortlessly adjustable as before. Luckily, the Quest 2 makes significant strides elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gwWuuSfTzWNDoS45b-iG9qG32-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-4-27f169e7e71b4372a38e13332b7b1364.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959707/19272" target="_top" id="1959707">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959707" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959707/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook"></a>Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook</h2><p> You should charge the Oculus Quest 2 out of the box, as the modest total battery life means a partially-charged headset isn’t going to last very long. You will need a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , either Android or iPhone, and the free Oculus app to complete setup, as well. Once the headset has a good charge, begin setup from the mobile app and then follow the guided directions, which will involve putting on, adjusting, and getting familiar with the headset itself.</p><p> Part of the setup process, and the process each time you use the headset, is to designate your play space by “drawing” a barrier within the augmented view of your surroundings seen through the headset’s cameras. From there, the headset determines whether you have enough space for active, room-scale experiences, or you can choose a stationary setup for seated play modes. During active play, a virtual barrier called the Oculus Guardian appears when you get close to the edges of your designated play space to help you avoid crashing into your surroundings. It’s all rather clever and effective.</p><p> There’s one other potential hitch with the Oculus Quest 2 that wasn’t present with the original: the new headset_requires_ a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tutorial-how-facebook-works-2654610" >Facebook account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and there’s no way around it. Facebook owns Oculus, and while the first Quest could be used simply with an Oculus account, the new one requires the social media account. For some, that may be a deal-breaker, given frustrations over privacy and the increasing role that Facebook plays in our society, so just know that going in.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915805/19272" target="_top" id="1915805">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915805" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915805/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade"><a href="#Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It’s a big upgrade"></a>Performance: It’s a big upgrade</h2><p> The original Oculus Quest did a fine job of delivering immersive VR experiences that didn’t feel compromised or significantly downgraded, even if it didn’t hit the same visual peaks as pricier, PC-powered headsets. And it was pretty amazing that the Quest did so with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, a chip found in 2017’s flagship smartphones.</p><p> The Oculus Quest 2 takes things to another level, and there are a few reasons why.</p><p> First off, the new Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chip here is based on the current Snapdragon 865 chip seen in phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Note20, and is three generations newer than the old chip.</p><p> It’s also paired with 50 percent more RAM (6GB) than the original Quest. Even more vividly, the fast-switching LCD screen packs in nearly 50 percent more pixels per eye than the old OLED panels did, for a noticeably crisper and smoother experience.</p><p> On the first Quest, you got 1440x1600 resolution per eye: solid, but a bit fuzzy and comparatively lower resolution than some of the PC headsets on the market. Here, however, the single screen provides 1832x1920 per eye, and the difference is obvious. While the switch from OLED to LCD technology should weaken the contrast a bit and dampen the deep black levels, I’ll be honest: I didn’t notice.</p><p> What I did notice was sharper interfaces and smoother action, with more fluid-feeling experiences that exhibited fewer of the occasional-yet-tolerable hitches seen with some games and apps on the first Quest headset.</p><p> Additionally, Oculus recently enabled the Quest 2 to hit a peak 90Hz screen refresh rate, up from 72Hz on the first headset, which will only help deliver that smoother-feeling usage. Developers must enable 90Hz within their apps and games, however.</p><p> I felt the Quest 2’s enhancements more prominently in some games over others. Laser sword-swinging music game Beat Saber, for example, ran well on the first headset and isn’t that different here—just smoother and clearer-looking. But with the online battle royale shooter Population: One, the cleaner-looking textures and more fluid performance helped mitigate some of the light motion sickness I felt playing on the first Quest.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones"></a>Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones</h2><p> Plugging in headphones delivers a more closed-off, immersive experience, but the Oculus Quest 2’s built-in speaker does a solid job of delivering audio and music. It does sound a tiny bit louder and fuller than the original Quest’s speaker, but not significantly so. Still, if you want to play without being fully shut-off from your surroundings, it works just fine.</p><h2 id="Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours"><a href="#Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours" class="headerlink" title="Battery: You’ll get a couple hours"></a>Battery: You’ll get a couple hours</h2><p> Like the original headset, the Oculus Quest 2 is rated for 2-3 hours of usage on a full charge. For such a compact, standalone headset, I think that’s reasonable. You get a couple hours to play, and then you can take a breather and do other things while it charges.</p><p> That said, if you’re keen on longer-lasting experiences, Oculus sells a $129 version of the Elite Strap with a built-in battery pack that doubles the play time, or you can get a portable battery pack, plug it in, and stick it in your pocket during use. Lastly, you could just use a lengthy USB-C cable and plug yourself into a wall. If you’re doing room-scale VR games and apps with free movement, however, you’ll need something longer—like 10 feet or more. Otherwise, some seated apps and games will work just fine when you’re tethered to a nearby wall outlet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ns2S3DQVema5UEDDSO8n3N7SC_4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-7-0a0e40b6a3064fe7abc985f0900dbeff.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC"><a href="#Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC" class="headerlink" title="Software: Use the headset or connect to PC"></a>Software: Use the headset or connect to PC</h2><p> The headset’s own interface hasn’t changed much from the first Quest, taking place in a 3D home-like environment with floating menus that you can access via the motion controllers. It’s a pretty easy way to choose between your currently installed games and apps, install anything else in your library, purchase and download new content, and access video content including apps like Netflix, YouTube, and SlingTV.</p><p> Oculus has also enabled optional hand tracking, including the use of hand and finger gestures to get around the interface and interact with some games. Hand tracking is definitely more finicky than using the controllers, however, and you’ll need solid lighting to really rely on it. That said, it does still feel experimental, and I encountered enough misread gestures and incorrect interactions to make me want to stick to the controllers. They work reliably great.</p><p> Since the original Quest’s launch, Oculus added the ability to connect the headset to a powerful PC to run more advanced VR experiences, and that carries over to the Quest 2, as well. You’ll need a PC that is capable of running headsets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as either the official Oculus Link USB-C cable ($80) or a comparable USB 3.1 cable that can handle the high-speed demands. I bought an unofficial cable for half the price on Amazon, and it worked great.</p><p> Using a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, I was able to play the visually demanding and deeply immersive Half-Life: Alyx on the Oculus Quest 2—a game that it could never run using its own internal hardware. It ran a little less smoothly than it did using the PC-native Valve Index headset, but not significantly so. This is a great way to experience higher-end VR games, including the new<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/star-wars-squadrons-review-5086656" >Star Wars: Squadrons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , for example. And with Oculus announcing plans to phase out PC-only headsets, it will also be a key part of the Quest platform’s future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/72vxixVr7kdKoLfUC3QkIrBl26I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-6-12fcb6054cf2475191bc613a3f26bcfc.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The $299 edition of the headset comes with 64GB of internal storage and the $399 version nets you 256GB, with some of each tally taken up by system software and resources. Luckily, the games and apps themselves aren’t huge, typically weighing in between 1-4GB apiece, sometimes less, and they’re pretty quick to download again if you want to revisit something. The 64GB edition should provide enough space for most players, as you could probably comfortably have a dozen or more games installed, along with streaming media apps, but anyone who wants to have a robust VR library on hand at all times without waiting might consider spending the extra cash.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043855/7443" target="_top" id="2043855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Games-A-good-growing-selection"><a href="#Games-A-good-growing-selection" class="headerlink" title="Games: A good, growing selection"></a>Games: A good, growing selection</h2><p> Although those aforementioned games and some others are still only found on PC (or maybe PlayStation VR on the PlayStation 4 or 5), the Oculus Quest platform has amassed a very nice selection of native games that you can download and play right on the headset.There is no difference in compatibility between the headsets: all Quest games play on Quest 2 and vice versa, just with performance differences.</p><p> Many of the early games from the impressive Quest launch lineup are still among the best games you can play on the Quest 2. The aforementioned Beat Saber, which finds you swinging your controllers to slash faux lightsabers through soaring rhythmic beats, is a frenetic blast, now with a larger library of songs including BTS and Linkin Park packs. Superhot VR is a stylish hybrid of a shooter and a puzzle game, of sorts, as you figure out how to clear through foes while avoiding incoming bullets that only move when you do. Meanwhile, the Star Wars VR game Vader Immortal still does a great job of creating an authentic atmosphere.</p><p> But there’s so much more now, too. Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite, both from developer Enhance Games, are trippy, trancelike experiences that you can sit down and really savor in VR. Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners and the aforementioned Population: One show that larger-scale shooter experiences can be immersive and compelling in VR, plus there’s a newer Star Wars game, Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge, that blends interactive storytelling with fun blaster battles.</p><p> There’s a lot of great stuff on Quest 2, ranging from simple arcade-like experiences to larger-scale adventures, quirky interactive experiences, and more. And on top of that, there are the aforementioned video services for 360-degree videos, plus fitness apps and games, VR chat for communicating with friends and random people, a web browser, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FqVvo044zoPghSD_PR1g2e0L2rs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-5-216bbf638cbe407b8b6f332abc94ae47.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137219/26400" target="_top" id="2137219">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137219" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137219/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Price-It’s-an-amazing-value"><a href="#Price-It’s-an-amazing-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s an amazing value"></a>Price: It’s an amazing value</h2><p> The Oculus Quest was already impressively priced at $399, so launching the more powerful Oculus Quest 2 at $299 is pretty phenomenal.

That said, if I had to compare it to another VR headset, I’d put it up against Sony’s PlayStation VR, which requires a PlayStation 4 or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> console.</p><p> The PSVR is a few years old now and is technically overshadowed by the Quest 2 in terms of screen and controller quality. Still, Sony has amassed some stellar exclusive games thanks to its partnerships with game developers, and the PlayStation VR is a solid, reasonably affordable pickup for anyone who already has a PS4 or PS5 console and wants to dabble in VR. But if you don’t already have the console, and you want to get into VR, go for the dedicated Quest 2 instead. It’ll be cheaper than buying a headset and console together, plus it’s a better VR experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-vr-review-4692684" >Sony PlayStation VR Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The best VR device, all things considered.</strong></p><p> The significant performance upgrade and surprising price drop outweigh some of the annoying design shifts with the Oculus Quest 2, making it the must-have VR headset for just about everyone. Not only does it play a great library of on-headset games, but it can also connect to a powerful PC to play even more games on top of that. Add to that the ease of use, quality gameplay, and immersive visuals, and the Oculus Quest 2 is another brilliant VR game console.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-rift-s-review-4764112" >Oculus Rift S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-go-vr-headset-review-4690298" >Oculus Go Standalone VR Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Quest 2</li><li>Product Brand  Meta</li><li>UPC  815820021292</li><li>Price  $299.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2020</li><li>Weight  1.1 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.54 x 5.61 x 4.02 in.</li><li>Color  Gray</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Android 10</li><li>Processor  Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2</li><li>RAM  6GB</li><li>Storage  64GB&#x2F;256GB</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-best-graphics-cards-for-4k-video-editing-and-rendering/"><u>[New] Best Graphics Cards for 4K Video Editing and Rendering</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-the-flip-side-to-visual-storytelling-how-to-rotate-your-images-on-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Flip-Side to Visual Storytelling How to Rotate Your Images on Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-instagram-mastery-top-10-gadgets-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Instagram Mastery Top 10 Gadgets for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/comprehensive-instructions-how-to-get-your-wd-ses-usb-device-drivers-up-and-running-after-2-cups-of-coffee-in-less-than-5-minutes/"><u>Comprehensive Instructions: How to Get Your WD SES USB Device Drivers Up and Running After 2 Cups of Coffee in Less than 5 Minutes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/elevate-your-instagram-game-with-stop-motion-pro-tips-and-techniques-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Your Instagram Game with Stop Motion Pro Tips and Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/exploring-microsofts-hololens-a-hologram-horizon-for-2024/"><u>Exploring Microsoft's HoloLens A Hologram Horizon for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/from-legacy-systems-to-modern-windows-the-win7-10-shift/"><u>From Legacy Systems to Modern Windows: The Win7-10 Shift</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/from-s21-to-s23-a-closer-look-at-the-evolution-of-ultra-premium-phones-with-our-in-depth-galaxy-comparison/"><u>From S21 to S23: A Closer Look at the Evolution of Ultra-Premium Phones with Our In-Depth Galaxy Comparison</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-iphone-11-pro-data-from-ios-itunes-backup-drfone-by-drfone-ios-data-recovery-ios-data-recovery/"><u>How to Recover iPhone 11 Pro Data From iOS iTunes Backup?

Read on to see our results.</em></p><p> The Mac mini (M1, 2020) is the first Mac desktop to receive Apple’s new<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/why-apple-designed-the-m1-chip-5087225" >ARM-based M1 chip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It’s also the most affordable way to dip your toe into the brave new world of Apple Silicon, even though it’s powered by the exact same chip found in the much more expensive MacBook Pro. It can’t<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/using-boot-camp-assistant-install-windows-2260115" >run Windows apps via Bootcamp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like an Intel Mac, and there will be some growing pains as developers switch gears and start catering to the new hardware, but that hardware offers tremendous raw performance, excellent potential in the long term, and more than acceptable real-world performance in the short term.</p><p> While I was a bit skeptical of Apple’s decision to leave Intel behind, the promised performance of their custom silicon left me eager to dig in and see how that raw power really translates into real-world situations. I was able to spend about a week with an M1 Mac mini as my main work machine, plugging in my keyboard and monitors, with my primary rig left to gather dust for the duration.</p><p> During my time with the M1 Mac mini, I paid close attention to performance, of course, with a special eye to how well it handles non-native apps and apps that were designed for iOS. The lack of support for Bootcamp meant I wasn’t able to completely leave my old hardware behind, but there’s no getting around it: this is some impressive hardware at any price, let alone a price tag that’s cheaper than the previous iteration of the hardware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/aEGPK4B55KCbhrof83878utZpZQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-2-16eb4e84f8694bb6a76cf078906add40.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111981/7443" target="_top" id="2111981">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111981" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111981/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Design-Same-sleek-aluminum-chassis"><a href="#Design-Same-sleek-aluminum-chassis" class="headerlink" title="Design: Same sleek aluminum chassis"></a>Design: Same sleek aluminum chassis</h2><p> The big changes here are all under the hood, as Apple opted to leave the overall design of the Mac mini (M1, 2020) unchanged from the previous model. It’s still a block of milled aluminum with the same rounded corners, satin finish, and shiny Apple logo emblazoned on the top. The top is smooth and unmarked aside from the logo, and the front and sides of the case are completely featureless aside from a small LED on the front that lets you know when the system is powered on.</p><p> The ports are all found around the back, where the aluminum case is cut away to accommodate a black plastic panel. There you’ll find a power button and socket for the power cable, an Ethernet port, two<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713" >USB-C&#x2F;Thunderbolt 3 ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , an HDMI port, two USB type A ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Situated just below this array of inputs is a cutout that reveals the internal heatsink.</p><p> The biggest change here from the last iteration of the hardware is that the last Mac mini featured four Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of just two. The configuration of the ports is even the same, drawing attention to the fact that just two ports occupy space that could easily support twice that number.</p><p> The bottom of the M1 Mac mini also remains unchanged from the last version of the hardware, with most of it taken up by a circular plastic cover that’s designed to allow easier access to the internals. As before, it causes the Mac mini to stand up a bit from whatever surface you place it on, and it has very little gripping power. If you place it on a slick surface, be aware that it could slide off with the slightest nudge.</p><p> Unlike the previous model, the M1 Mac mini doesn’t have any user serviceable parts or components. That means you’re stuck with the memory and storage configurations you choose at check out, and you can’t go back in later to add extra RAM or a bigger SSD.</p><p> The biggest disappointment here, aside from the fact that the M1 Mac mini didn’t receive any sort of aesthetic update, is that Apple removed two Thunderbolt ports and the ability to upgrade your memory. The first isn’t that big of an issue, since the Mac mini looked great before and still looks great. The lack of Thunderbolt ports, similarly, isn’t a huge deal, because there are a ton of ways to get around such a limitation. The lack of upgradeability certainly removes a degree of flexibility from the hardware, though, making it much more important to select the amount of memory and storage that you’ll be comfortable with for the life of the device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xpt3pmIvU6FTBUo0tBDpyp3BERE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-3-844f657110aa424db6f1e5bac1b19eda.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-painless-but-you-can’t-use-a-Bluetooth-keyboard-or-mouse"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-painless-but-you-can’t-use-a-Bluetooth-keyboard-or-mouse" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and painless, but you can’t use a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse"></a>Setup Process: Fast and painless, but you can’t use a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse</h2><p> If you’ve ever set up a macOS device before, the setup process isn’t any different here. It’s just a matter of accepting some terms, tweaking some initial settings, and connecting your Apple ID. As always, setup is going to be easier if you have access to another functional piece of Apple hardware that you’re already logged into.</p><p> The one wrinkle that you may run into is that you can’t set up the Mac mini with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. You’ll need to plug a wired keyboard and mouse in to complete the setup process and then pair your Bluetooth hardware, or use a keyboard and mouse combo that uses a wireless dongle.</p><p> For example, I was able to plug in the dongle from my Logitech K400+ Touch Keyboard, and the Mac mini recognized the peripheral immediately. That allowed me to complete the setup process without digging around for wired peripherals.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135411/19272" target="_top" id="2135411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135411/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Unreal-performance-with-some-hiccups"><a href="#Performance-Unreal-performance-with-some-hiccups" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Unreal performance with some hiccups"></a>Performance: Unreal performance with some hiccups</h2><p> While the Mac mini (M1, 2020) remained mostly unchanged from a design perspective, the internals received a massive overhaul. This is Apple’s first desktop to receive its new M1 chip, and that’s a really big deal. Though one of the M1’s headline features, reduced power use, isn’t as big a deal here as it is in the MacBook Air, this chip is still massively more powerful than anything you’ve ever seen in a Mac before. In fact, the Mac mini has the exact same chip as the MacBook Pro, with one more GPU core than the MacBook Air.</p><p> The M1 CPU features eight cores, including four performance cores and four efficiency cores, and the same chip also includes an eight core GPU.</p><p> This isn’t an Intel integrated graphics situation, though. The M1 boasts some pretty impressive processing power from both the CPU and GPU components. In real world terms, that translates to silky-smooth day to day operation from Big Sur, fast-loading and running apps, speedy video rendering and image editing, and intriguing possibilities in the realm of gaming.</p><p> While the numbers Apple has tossed around have been impressive, and my own experience with the M1 hardware was almost uniformly positive, I had to run some benchmarks. First up, I ran the Cinebench multi-core test. The Mac mini achieved a score of 7,662 in that test, putting it between an Intel Xeon E5-2697 at 3GHz and an X5650 Xeon processor at 3.66Ghz. That’s almost within spitting distance of an eight core AMD Ryzen 7 1700X, but only about half the score of a 1950X Threadripper.</p><p> For a processor in a mini-computer at this price range, the M1 turned in decent enough multi-core numbers. When running the single-core Cinebench test though, decent goes right out the window. In that test, the M1 Mac mini scored 1,521, which is the second highest score Cinebench has on record.</p><p> I also ran a few gaming benchmarks from GFXBench Metal. I started with Car Chase, which is a benchmark that simulates a 3D game with advanced shaders, lighting effects, and more. The M1 Mac mini scored a decent 60.44fps in that test, which would be entirely playable if we were dealing with a real game and not a benchmark. It scored a nearly identical 60fps in the less-intense T-Rex benchmark.</p><p> In addition to GFXBench, I also ran the WildLife benchmark from 3DMark that’s designed for iOS, made possible by Big Sur’s native support for iOS applications. In that test, the Mac mini scored 17,930 overall and registered 107fps. Both numbers were a bit higher than the MacBook Air managed on the same test, which is understandable since the Mac mini GPU has one more core.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/H6vCqcN2s5HOQG5MJWawrPxairg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-6-cd1693bee2f4429fafd1a57ecffbce81.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Gaming-Limited-but-promising"><a href="#Gaming-Limited-but-promising" class="headerlink" title="Gaming: Limited but promising"></a>Gaming: Limited but promising</h2><p> This is one area where Apple’s decision to switch from Intel to their own bespoke silicon is unlikely to pay off for a while. The issue is that while the M1 chip is powerful, it’s going to take a while for game developers to offer any kind of real support for it. That means the already anemic Mac gaming scene could be even more anemic until devs see a reason to put substantial resources into games that run natively on the ARM-based M1 hardware. In the long term, cross-compatibility between macOS and iOS apps could end up being a massive game-changer.</p><p> Since the gaming scene was already anemic on macOS, a lot of gaming on Macs is really done in Windows via Bootcamp. If you do a lot of gaming on your current Mac, you’re probably familiar with big tentpole video game titles that never make it off Windows in the first place, and afterthought macOS ports that are poorly optimized and run a whole lot better if you just play the same game on the same hardware in Windows.</p><p> With the switch to ARM-based architecture, the Mac mini no longer provides the option to run Windows alongside macOS, so that gaming option is gone. Windows can’t run on this hardware, so the only way to play Windows-only games is through a virtual machine environment, which is not a good way to play games. That means you just won’t be able to play some games if you rely on a Mac mini, or any M1-based Mac, as your only gaming rig.</p><p> The issue is that while the M1 chip is powerful, it’s going to take a while for game developers to offer any kind of real support for it.</p><p> However, thanks to Rosetta 2, the Mac mini can play any game that’s designed to run in macOS on an Intel machine. There’s some level of performance cost involved, but I wasn’t able to notice it with any of the games I played. Notably, I was able to run<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-steam-4177380" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> using Rosetta 2 and then download and play macOS games through Steam seamlessly.</p><p> Civilization 6 is currently in the middle of a nearly year-long content drip, and I was able to fire it up via Rosetta 2 and Steam with zero issues. Even with the world size cranked up all the way, more civs than recommended, and maxed out city states, the M1 sailed along effortlessly with fast load times and tolerably snappy AI turns.</p><p> For something less demanding, yet much more fast-paced, I fired up Rocket League. Though Psyonix technically no longer supports macOS, I was able to download and launch through Steam, and set up a local match. It ran without a hitch, with zero slowdown or stuttering as the cars zipped around the arena at breakneck pace.</p><p> The last game I tried out was Streets of Rage 4, the long-awaited fourth entry in the Streets of Rage series that finally arrived earlier this year. The fast-paced online brawler ran just as smoothly as it does on my Windows gaming rig, with no lag or slow down at all.</p><p> Aside from lack of support from game developers, the only real drawback here in terms of gaming comes from the HDMI port itself. While the M1 Mac mini can pump out<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it’s limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. That’s fine for most casual gamers, but anyone who has fallen in love with their high refresh rate monitor will experience a bit of pain here.</p><h2 id="Productivity-Ready-for-work"><a href="#Productivity-Ready-for-work" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Ready for work"></a>Productivity: Ready for work</h2><p> The great thing about the Mac mini line is that it’s always been so flexible. You can use a Mac mini for work, but the size and relative affordability of the hardware means you aren’t locked into using it that way. If you do aim to use an M1 Mac mini for work though, it’s more than up to the task. Native apps and the operating system itself run fast and smooth as you could possibly hope, with none of the sitting around looking at spinning beach balls that you may have gotten used to with older hardware.</p><p> Thanks to the emulation offered by Rosetta 2, the M1 offers most tools people will need for productivity. If you currently run an app in macOS on older hardware, Rosetta 2 will allow you to run it on an M1 Mac mini until a native app arrives. And even if a native app doesn’t arrive, your productivity shouldn’t be affected too much.</p><p> I was able to run apps like Photoshop and Lightroom through Rosetta 2 without a hitch or even a hint of slowdown.</p><p> Those are both examples of apps that will get native -versions, according to Adobe, but they run pretty well under Rosetta 2 in the meantime.</p><p> Multitasking also works flawlessly, and I was able to juggle an impressive number of browser windows, intensive apps like Photoshop and Handbrake, voice and video chat over Discord, and more without running into any real problems.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304647">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304647%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304647/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-It’s-there-if-you-need-it"><a href="#Audio-It’s-there-if-you-need-it" class="headerlink" title="Audio: It’s there if you need it"></a>Audio: It’s there if you need it</h2><p> The M1 Mac mini is great in almost every category, but audio isn’t one of them. There’s a speaker inside that sleek aluminum block, but it isn’t one you’ll care to listen to. It’s tinny and hollow, and absolutely a placeholder for more capable external speakers. You’ll want to hook up headphonesor some kind of speakers or soundbar shortly after setting the M1 Mac mini up, because the built-in speaker isn’t really even suitable for watching YouTube videos, let alone listening to music or streaming your favorite shows or movies.</p><p> The M1 Mac mini does include a 3.5mm headphone jack on the back along with built-in Bluetooth, so you have a lot of options. Just make sure to budget for some sort of external speakers or headphones, because you don’t want to get stuck with the built-in speaker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OZrKjTPGUmo00carhaedBa9WhTU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-5-bc84da59dfdf440c8d53a096509c232b.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Network-Solid-Ethernet-and-Wi-Fi-6-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Solid-Ethernet-and-Wi-Fi-6-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Solid Ethernet and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity"></a>Network: Solid Ethernet and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity</h2><p> The Mac mini includes a wired gigabit Ethernet jack, support for Bluetooth 5.0, and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> network card that’s also 801.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n&#x2F;ac compatible. Performance from the wired and wireless networking options was uniformly strong, with fast download speeds and no issues streaming 4K video or video chatting.</p><p> To test the M1 Mac mini’s network capabilities, I used a gigabit connection from Mediacom that measured just shy of 1Gbps at the modem at the time of testing. First I hooked up to the router via Ethernet and checked the speed using the Speedtest app from Ookla. With the wired connection, the M1 Mac mini turned in an impressive 937Mbps down, which is one of the fastest measurements I’ve seen on this connection. At the same time, it measured an upload speed of 63.7Mbps, which is close to the upper limit of this connection.</p><p> I also tested the wireless connection, hooking the M1 Mac mini to my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/eero-pro-mesh-wi-fi-system-review-4797008" >Eero mesh network <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Big Sur was built specifically for this hardware and to integrate seamlessly with Rosetta 2 for running legacy Intel macOS apps, and a number of first party Apple apps also run natively, but that’s about it at launch.</p><p> I’ve already touched on it a few times, but the biggest casualty of Apple’s move to in-house ARM-based silicon is that the hardware doesn’t let you dual boot Windows, and x86 emulation for Windows apps is also a no-go. The good news is that a new version of Parallels Desktop for Mac that will run on M1 hardware is on the way, but some apps require dual booting, or run poorly in a virtual machine environment, so that won’t solve every problem for everyone.</p><p> Software is the biggest stumbling block for M1 hardware during these early days, as there isn’t a whole lot out there that’s actually designed to run on Apple Silicon.</p><p> The bottom line is that if you currently rely on Bootcamp for a Windows application or utility that you need for work, or even just for gaming, the M1 Mac mini just won’t run that software for you.

The baseline M1 Mac mini is actually hundreds of dollars cheaper than the previous iteration of the hardware, which is remarkable considering how much more powerful it is. The last Intel Mac mini was already a good deal, so the even cheaper M1 Mac mini looks even better in comparison.

The two mini desktops share an identical form factor, with the Intel version coming in Space Gray and the M1 version finished in Silver. The Intel Mac mini has a base price of $1,099 compared to $699 or $899 for the M1 Mac mini.</p><p> The Intel Mac mini is more similar to the $899 model of the M1 hardware since both come with 512GB of storage. They also both have 8GB of RAM. Where the M1 Mac mini has the 8-core M1 chip, the Intel version includes a 6-core Intel Core i5 and integrated Intel UHD Graphics 630.</p><p> In terms of performance, the M1 Mac mini blows the Intel version out of the water. The Intel version does include a couple extra Thunderbolt ports though, and it can do one thing the M1 version can’t: run Windows via Bootcamp.</p><p> If you don’t have any need to run Windows apps, then there’s no real question. The M1 Mac mini is superior, and it costs less. The Intel Mac mini is worth considering if you absolutely need to run Windows apps and don’t mind the extra cost, but the question then becomes whether the Mac mini is really the best platform to be running those Windows apps considering how much more expensive it is than a pure Windows machine of similar capabilities.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-mini-pcs-4047271" >The Best Home Theater PCs of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If you’re weighing different options, be sure to check out our guide for the best laptops.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>If all you need is a Mac, the M1 Mac mini is your destination.</strong></p><p> The Apple Mac mini with M1 is a tremendously impressive piece of hardware, offering staggering performance at an affordable price. The only real catch here is that in leaving Intel behind, Apple may have left you in the lurch.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Everyone loves zombies, but there are so many zombie shooters, it can be hard to tell them apart. But when we played 7 Days to Die, we jumped for joy and grabbed our digital cricket bats, fully prepared to go full Shaun of the Dead on hordes of the undead. A game loosely based around a nuclear fallout that ends with the fall of civilization and the spawning of undead, hungry friends sounds like a good time. Racking up over 500 hours on the game, we’ve tested it across four major alpha updates, taking note of gameplay, plot, ease of use, and price. Read on to find out our thoughts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MW5wYA5ujBjG5LdXn-w9bTJd5WQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-2-a59091cd21c04d99a42270199349fc2a.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068412/7443" target="_top" id="2068412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-thanks-to-Steam"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-thanks-to-Steam" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy thanks to Steam"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy thanks to Steam</strong></h2><p> 7 Days to Die for PC can be located on Steam, making it easy to set up. It takes a little while to download, but once it boots up, you’re in. You’ll press the “New Game” button and you’ll need to create a new character, which is easy if you choose one of the preset characters from the list. If you’d like to make a unique character, it’s easy with a creation system similar to Skyrim. Everything, down to the very arch on the eyebrows, is customizable.</p><p> One of the nicest aspects about 7 Days is that when you boot up a game, and even after, you have a plethora of options to customize gameplay. Do you want Scavenger (easiest setting) or do you want to play on the hardest settings in which the game actually tells you, “You’re one bad mother!”? Do you want the 24-hour cycle to span 30 minutes or two hours of real time? Do you want zombies to sprint at night? How many zombies do you want in your day 7 horde? These are all great options for creating unique and challenging gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Eq0YCIdbj82yj3lOCWEdZS7jX6w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-4-341174c3997543728bd2b024c6e2a309.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137412/7443" target="_top" id="2137412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137209/26400" target="_top" id="2137209">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137209" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137209/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-Open-world-horror-sandbox"><a href="#Plot-Open-world-horror-sandbox" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Open world horror sandbox"></a><strong>Plot: Open world horror sandbox</strong></h2><p> When you first begin gameplay, it takes about 20 seconds for it to boot up, and then you’re gasping, holding your bare hands out before you, drinking in the landscape of one of five biomes: snow, forest, desert, wasteland, and burnt.</p><p> A prompt flashes onto the screen, beginning a brief tutorial on how to address the basics of the game. This tutorial will take you through basic crafting, helping you to craft axes, plant fiber clothing, and wooden weapons like clubs and bows. It also helps direct you to the nearest Traitor Joe’s general store, where you can buy vital supplies and weapons—but sorry, no overnight stays. After you’ve finished the tutorial, you get some skill points to spend on your skills page, we’ll cover that in more detail below.</p><p> You need water and you need to hunt, forage, and scavenge to survive. You will feel the effects of heat as the desert raises your temperature, and you will starve as the snow biome depletes your caloric intake.</p><p> Once you complete the tutorial, it’s an open sandbox sprinkled with horror and survival elements. The game loosely hints of nuclear fallout, but what matters is civilization has recently fallen and you’re the only person alive. Other than that, the world is yours for the conquering. Alpha 17 does have some smaller quests from Traitor Joe’s, like clearing out zombies in a location, or digging up instructions in a marked spot on the map, but overall the goal is survival. Now, this may seem like an easy feat. After all, zombies are shambling, drooling monsters, but 7 Days to Die may surprise you (more on that later).</p><p> The other, titular part of the plot: every seven days, a zombie horde descends upon you. They know your location. They will find you and claw their way to you, and you have to fend yourself and your base from them. As the 7 days pass, they get harder to defeat. Our understanding is that the end goal of 7 Days is to add a story, but right now they’re focused on honing in general gameplay. We hope that the story will be optional since as a survival horror sandbox, it works very well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/U2XChOqkiQvFhP69V0cQ5mYcYME=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-3-d19d9b4d19734cffb022d6e0db90382e.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Could-be-better-but-solid-overall"><a href="#Gameplay-Could-be-better-but-solid-overall" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Could be better, but solid overall"></a><strong>Gameplay: Could be better, but solid overall</strong></h2><p> 7 Days to Die boasts two playable maps: Navezgane, which is a massive square map consisting of five biomes in which you can use the sandbox world to your advantage; and random map generation, which is a map that randomly spawns cities and biomes. The latter is for players who want a greater challenge, as no random map is the same. The former, however, has fun elements like a school, complete with charging football zombies, and a strip club. From these two kinds of maps alone, gameplay can last for hours (as we said, we’ve clocked in 500 hours at this point).</p><p> Zombies are supposed to be shambling, drooling monsters with a penchant for brains. However, in 7 Days, Alpha 17 updated it so that these zombies are intelligent. They know when you’ve crafted and set any traps—and they maneuver around them with ease.</p><p> As we previously mentioned, zombies are supposed to be shambling, drooling monsters with a penchant for brains. However, Alpha 17 updated the game so that these zombies are intelligent. They know when you’ve crafted and set any traps—and they maneuver around them with ease. It’s mildly frustrating when you’re trying to protect your base from them and the developers have amped it up so high that you really struggle to defend your base.</p><p> However, if you like that sort of challenge, then, by all means, club and shoot your way through the horde and have a blast. That said, 7 Days also boasts some really cool zombies which make gameplay unpredictable and unique. These include: screamer zombies, which alert and spawn hordes with a banshee-like shriek; spider zombies, which can climb through your windows for an unexpected evening soiree; and policeman zombies, who are a solid combination reminiscent of the Spitter and Boomer from the Left 4 Dead franchise.</p><p> There’s also a skill tree that grants you improved abilities as you go along. We feel this skill tree is mildly flawed, as they want you to slowly build up levels and restrict important aspects—like the forge and bikes—until level 20. In order to do this, you have to grind your way through hordes, as slaying zombies is the most effective way to gain experience and level up. If this is your preference, then you’ll have a blast with this game. If you prefer building and crafting, then we recommend opting for something like Minecraft or Terraria. One quick note—because this is a work in progress game, Alpha 18 has promised to restructure this, so this could change when the new update drops.</p><p> One more huge perk is that each building in the game is like a mini dungeon. Filled with traps, sleeping zombies, and lots of loot, it’s a great addition to a game that needed a little extra effort to make the game fun and playable. For example, in one home we raided on multiplayer, one of us fell through a weak floorboard and ended up in a room full of zombies. However, the loot in the house—a hunting rifle, with a couple weapons modifications to make stronger weapons—made it fun, unpredictable, and worth the scares.</p><p> Every seven days, a zombie horde descends upon you. They know your location. They will find you and claw their way to you, and you have to fend yourself and your base from them.</p><p> For the most part, the controls are really easily manageable on the PC, consisting of the basic, fairly universal WASD keyboard controls. If you don’t like the WASD controls, it’s also very easy to go in and alter them. We liked the ease of use, as we were able to jump into the two maps the game boasts without a rough start. We also liked that because of the easy controls, it was easy to attack zombies with melee and ranged weapons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O0do2JbbpgP_VF7azi5OhENnDpc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-5-13eba1dcdd7d45b48c0c3d07711686e6.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Graphics-Outdated-but-detailed-on-optimal"><a href="#Graphics-Outdated-but-detailed-on-optimal" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Outdated, but detailed on optimal"></a><strong>Graphics: Outdated, but detailed on optimal</strong></h2><p> For a game that was released in 2013 originally, the graphics could be a little better, even if you play on optimal settings. Back in the day, we played on lower settings rather than splurge on a fancy graphics card. If you play on the lower settings, it’s cringeworthy, though not as cringeworthy as the Witcher 3’s lowest settings.</p><p> 7 Days has a decent 3D graphics system that they’ve definitely improved as the alpha updates have been released. As a consequence, the minimum requirements have also increased. Those who play on minimum settings may want to take note of that. While we hope they’ll improve these over the next alpha updates, we are taking the graphics as they are at the time of this review, and right now, while they’re detailed on optimal settings, they could be better.</p><p> Because the graphics are a rather mixed bag, the frames per second (fps) can vary dramatically. We experienced drops as low as 18 fps when playing. When surrounded by a horde, that can cost you your life.</p><h2 id="Platform-It’s-complicated"><a href="#Platform-It’s-complicated" class="headerlink" title="Platform: It’s complicated"></a><strong>Platform: It’s complicated</strong></h2><p> 7 Days to Die runs on many platforms:<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mac-4155662" >PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ps4-ps4-slim-and-ps4-pro-4154452" >PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-360-buyers-guide-3562451" >Xbox 360 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . We played 7 Days on PC, and at the time of writing, they released a teaser for the Alpha 18 update which would roll out to the PC version of the game.</p><p> Last time we checked, the company that owned all console rights, Telltale, went bust, and The Fun Pimps (the developer) were in legal limbo trying to reacquire their own rights. There’s a good chance that there will not be an update in the console versions of the game anytime soon as this issue makes its way through the courts. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you purchase the PC version if you decide this is a game you might like to try.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959764/19272" target="_top" id="1959764">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959764" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959764/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Average-for-an-alpha-game"><a href="#Price-Average-for-an-alpha-game" class="headerlink" title="Price: Average for an alpha game"></a><strong>Price: Average for an alpha game</strong></h2><p> At around $25, 7 Days isn’t the most expensive zombie game on the market. However, it is the most expensive alpha zombie game out there. Because you can purchase it on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-steam-4177380" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Humble Bumble, we recommend waiting for a Steam sale and getting it for a discount, especially since it’s still in progress. This way, if you decide you don’t like it in the future, you aren’t out the full price.</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-sandbox-shooters"><a href="#Competition-Other-sandbox-shooters" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other sandbox shooters"></a><strong>Competition: Other sandbox shooters</strong></h2><p> It’s hard to compare 7 Days to other sandboxes out there because of the significant focus on crafting and building.<a class="link"   href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/" >Minecraft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has expansive crafting and arguably good graphics with its classic blocky appearance. Terraria also boasts zombies and crafting and building capabilities, though they’re 2D instead of 3D like in 7 Days. And all of them can guarantee hours of gameplay with fun twists and turns.</p><p> If anything can set these games apart, it’s the sheer realism of 7 Days. You need water and you need to hunt, forage, and scavenge to survive. You will feel the effects of heat as the desert raises your temperature, and you will starve as the snow biome depletes your caloric intake. And that’s all before we’ve mentioned the wolves and zombie bears (yes, they exist, and no, they are not easy to take down) in 7 Days. If you like a sense of realism in your zombie games, then 7 Days is for you. If not, we suggest taking a look at Minecraft or<a class="link"   href="https://terraria.org/" >Terraria <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>If you love smart zombies, you’ll love this game.</strong></p><p> Despite flaws in graphics, there’s a lot to love about 7 Days to Die. The challenging skill tree system and dangerous intelligent zombies add an element that’s not typically found in zombie shooters. If you want a game to commit to for hours on end, building bases and exploring dungeon-like homes while slaying zombie cheerleaders, then 7 Days to Die could be a fun way to ease some stress after a long day of work.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li>The Last of Us Remastered</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/days-gone-review-4778364" >Days Gone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dying-light-review-4778324" >Dying Light <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  7 Days to Die</li><li>UPC  017817770613</li><li>Price  $24.99</li><li>Release Date  December 2013</li><li>Available Platforms  PC, PS 4, Xbox</li><li>Processor Minimum  2.4 GHz Dual Core CPU</li><li>Memory Minimum  6 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics  1 GB Dedicated Memory</li><li>Game Updates  Alpha 17.4 out; Alpha 18 Announced</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-precision-and-perfection-applying-luts-in-video-post-production/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Precision and Perfection Applying LUTs in Video Post-Production</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-flight-to-imagery-a-review-of-dji-sparks-miniature-drone-innovation/"><u>2024 Approved Flight to Imagery A Review of DJI Spark's Miniature Drone Innovation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-screen-mirroring-oneplus-nord-ce-3-5g-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Screen Mirroring OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G to PC? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-anti-tracker-software-for-nokia-c300-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Best Anti Tracker Software For Nokia C300 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/prank-your-friends-easy-ways-to-fake-and-share-google-maps-location-on-honor-90-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Prank Your Friends!

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re interested in moving more and monitoring daily activities with the help of a chic fitness-tracking watch, the Garmin Vivomove HR is worth a closer look. The is an accessory aimed at those who like to be active and stylish too. I wore and used this watch for over a week and was impressed with the look of it, level of wellness data captured, and the overall support it offers for general well-being.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/I4tLxDp9_npPph8lgb8sOWODnd4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivomove-HR-Fitness-Tracker-Watch-3-c8e32586b7d840a0a2c9747a6255b802.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivomove HR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130530/26400" target="_top" id="2130530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130530/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Looks-like-a-polished-regular-watch"><a href="#Design-Looks-like-a-polished-regular-watch" class="headerlink" title="Design: Looks like a polished regular watch"></a><strong>Design: Looks like a polished regular watch</strong></h2><p> Some people enjoy the sporty design of an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-models-4175232" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Samsung smartwatch. But if you feel like you’re compromising utility over personal style with those options, the Garmin Vivomove HR offers a happy middle ground.</p><p> The watch I tested was fitted with a brown leather band and gold stainless steel case. If you were to glance at it, you wouldn’t be able to tell that there’s a lot going on underneath the surface. With a simple turn of the wrist the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091" >OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , placed discreetly in the bottom center of the watch face, illuminates for at-a-glance access to step count and other data. The watch hands also conveniently move out of the way for better visibility and return to reflect the current time when not in use.</p><p> The overall size of the Vivomove HR is 43 x 43 x 11.6 millimeters (HWD) and the display measures 0.38 x 0.76 inches. On larger wrists, this won’t be a big deal, but smaller wrists like mine could face a fit challenge since the face is on the larger side. But the device as a whole only weighs 56.5 grams, which won’t weigh you down. It also comes with a 5 ATM water-resistance rating, which means you’re good to use this for lap swimming and other water sports, and won’t need to worry about rain and snow exposure. I wore this watch in the shower and when washing dishes and found it to be effective against repelling water and always dried quickly.</p><p> In terms of design quirks, in lieu of a typical micro USB charging cord, this watch features a charging clip with a USB connection. The clip opens easily and must be placed directly onto the charging contacts on the back of the watch face in order to charge&#x2F;transfer data. This charging method is a bit of a quirk of some Garmin watches, but it eliminates the need for charging ports that could be at risk when exposed to moisture.</p><h2 id="Setup-Fast-pairing-with-Garmin-Connect"><a href="#Setup-Fast-pairing-with-Garmin-Connect" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Fast pairing with Garmin Connect"></a><strong>Setup: Fast pairing with Garmin Connect</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Garmin Vivomove HR is easy through the Garmin Connect app. I already had the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> downloaded on my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/pick-best-iphone-for-you-1999293" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which made the fast setup process speedier. The app immediately detected the Vivomove HR and then presented on-screen instructions for calibrating the watch hands, setting the wrist placement (right or left), widget preferences, and touring basic functions. This took a matter of minutes since the Garmin Vivomove HR was nearly fully charged out of the box.</p><h2 id="Comfort-Comfortable-for-all-day-wear-but-the-screen-can-be-finicky"><a href="#Comfort-Comfortable-for-all-day-wear-but-the-screen-can-be-finicky" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Comfortable for all-day wear, but the screen can be finicky"></a><strong>Comfort: Comfortable for all-day wear, but the screen can be finicky</strong></h2><p> I wore the Garmin Vivomove HR during waking and sleeping hours and never experienced discomfort while I slept. If I did experience any issues, it was during the day when conducting routine tasks—especially typing. Invariably the watch would shift and the larger face made contact with my wristbone.</p><p> The wellness data, especially with consistent daily wear, was helpful and motivated me to move more.</p><p> During sleeping hours, though, I wasn’t disturbed by any shifting of the timepiece. And since sleep mode is on by default, I wasn’t bothered by notifications or the screen illuminating. When trying to fall asleep or during waking moments, I was occasionally startled by the green light from the heart-rate sensor on the back of the watch face. If you get a tight fit against your wrist, this shouldn’t be an issue.</p><p> In terms of overall ease of use, the only actions you’ll need to master are touching and swiping the screen: there are no buttons or bezels to deal with. Touch prompts sound like a no-brainer and an appealing way to interact with the watch, but I found the screen to be fussy and slow to respond at times. If I didn’t tap the screen in just the right way, I had to repeatedly tap until I could stop or start a workout timer. And if I failed to complete a full sweeping motion through the widgets, the screen wouldn’t advance to the next item. Instead I ended up just drilling down further into that particular category.</p><p> For example, if I didn’t fully swipe past the weather widget information for the day, the screen would take me to the weekly forecast. Then I had to press the back button to get to the general widgets screen. With continued use, I became savvier with touch and swiping actions, but it was still a consistent issue when trying to start&#x2F;stop workout timers. This was an even bigger issue outside and in bright sunlight, which made the screen virtually undetectable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135350/19272" target="_top" id="2135350">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135350" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135350/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-A-cheerleader-for-wellness-rather-than-training"><a href="#Performance-A-cheerleader-for-wellness-rather-than-training" class="headerlink" title="Performance: A cheerleader for wellness rather than training"></a><strong>Performance: A cheerleader for wellness rather than training</strong></h2><p> The Vivomove HR is a well-rounded device. Not only does it look fashionable as an everyday accessory, but it also offers stopwatch functions, monitors heart rate (resting and active), automatically tracks activities such as running, walking, and even using an elliptical machine, and tracks steps, calories, and other fitness data such as VO2 max.</p><p> The wellness data, especially with consistent daily wear, was helpful and motivated me to move more. The Move Bar, while annoying, ultimately encouraged me to avoid prolonged periods of sitting or standing by simply reminding me to move if I hadn’t been very active in the last hour. But when it comes to accuracy as a fitness tracker, I wasn’t wildly impressed.</p><p> On a few short 1 to 3-mile runs, the Vivomove HR recorded my speed as up to 1 minute faster than my Garmin Forerunner 35 running watch. Heart rate was also considerably more elevated according to the Vivomove. And when I launched a strength training activity, the counter was always behind by about five reps. The Move IQ technology that auto-detects workouts didn’t always get it right either. Frequently when I was walking, the watch logged that stretch of movement as a running or an elliptical machine session.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VpHve66CRb4yVumQ8GVo-3vNLGQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivomove-HR-Fitness-Tracker-Watch-2-240036104f704a2d8c8f8425f075709b.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivomove HR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2148127/17093" target="_top" id="2148127">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2148127" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2148127/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Key-Features-Options-options-options"><a href="#Software-Key-Features-Options-options-options" class="headerlink" title="Software&#x2F;Key Features: Options, options, options"></a><strong>Software&#x2F;Key Features: Options, options, options</strong></h2><p> Fortunately, saving workout information and viewing any activity from the watch is easy and foolproof through the Garmin Connect app. If you prefer to set this watch up and sync data using your computer, the Garmin Express software allows you to complete the same steps for setting up and configuring the device along with syncing data with your Garmin Connect account and checking for software updates.</p><p> It’s entirely possible to choose between either setup, despite the quick-start instructions that indicate everything should be done through the mobile app. But using the app alone and syncing regularly helps send automatic software updates directly to the device when not in use. At any point you can log in to the Garmin Connect web app, regardless of which way you decide to sync data, to view your information on a larger display and download it.</p><p> The key features of the software revolve around basic activity tracking from climbing flights of stairs to monitoring all-day stress levels (based on heart rate) to breaking down hours of deep versus light sleep. While this is information you can glance at on your watch, the app distills all of this general wellness into daily, weekly, and monthly reports.</p><p> There’s also plenty of customization power when it comes to organizing the activity tracking data you see on your watch display and in the app itself. You can choose the widgets displayed such as music controls to control music on your smartphone and the number of intensity workout minutes you’ve reached for the week. And if you prefer to shuffle the way that data is arranged in the mobile app, there’s a simple drag and drop feature that helps you do that.</p><p> This complementary software also places the control in your hands when it comes to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-social-media-explaining-the-big-trend-3486616" >social media <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> sharing and integrating with outside fitness-tracking platforms such as Map My Run and Strava—which you can easily do from the Garmin Connect mobile and web apps.</p><p> In terms of design quirks, in lieu of a typical micro USB charging cord, this watch features a charging clip with a USB connection.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012401/19272" target="_top" id="2012401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Solid-performance-for-five-days"><a href="#Battery-Solid-performance-for-five-days" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Solid performance for five days"></a><strong>Battery: Solid performance for five days</strong></h2><p> Garmin says that this watch can last for over two weeks in watch mode and up to five days in smartwatch mode—which I can confirm. This claim tracked even with frequent glancing at the display and toggling through the widgets as well as receiving regular text and email updates throughout the day. I didn’t see the battery drain in any consistent way until the fifth day. And recharging the watch was fast: it took about only one hour.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1167086/14483" target="_top" id="1167086">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1167086" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1167086/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Expensive-but-it-has-a-touchscreen"><a href="#Price-Expensive-but-it-has-a-touchscreen" class="headerlink" title="Price: Expensive, but it has a touchscreen"></a><strong>Price: Expensive, but it has a touchscreen</strong></h2><p> The Garmin Vivomove HR ranges in price from around $200 for the Sport version that comes with a silicone band to $350 for Premium leather-band alternatives. There are certainly cheaper hybrid smartwatch options on the market. Both the Withings Move Steel HR and Fossil Smartwatch HR Collider retail for less than $200. And while they offer similar features such as message previews, heart rate, weather and sleep data, and even GPS, neither offers a touchscreen display and unique health data like stress level readings based on heart rate patterns.</p><h2 id="Garmin-Vivomove-HR-vs-Withings-Move-Steel-HR"><a href="#Garmin-Vivomove-HR-vs-Withings-Move-Steel-HR" class="headerlink" title="Garmin Vivomove HR vs. Withings Move Steel HR"></a><strong>Garmin Vivomove HR vs. Withings Move Steel HR</strong></h2><p> The Withings Move Steel HR ($180 MSRP) also occupies a similar space. It matches the Vivomove HR by offering optical wrist-based heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, water-resistance up to 50 meters, and smartphone notifications. The Withings Move Steel HR also has a stylish analog watch look, but if you prefer a flat over curved face and a touchscreen you can interact with, the Vivomove HR takes the prize. Heart-rate tracking inconsistencies plague both watches, but the Withings does come with connected GPS compatibility.</p><p> While this is a boon for distance tracking during workouts, the downside is that you’ll need to have your smartphone with you. The Withings Move Steel HR battery longevity is supposed to be 25 days and an additional month without smart mode turned off. But if you prefer the touchscreen interaction rather than the dual displays—one dial that monitors step count progress by percentage and one LCD that displays notifications—the Vivomove could be worth the extra money.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A quality hybrid watch that’s best for general wellness tracking and basic smart features.</strong></p><p> The Garmin Vivomove HR isn’t the watch to reach for when you want to accurately log running or cycling workouts, but if you want a larger bird’s-eye view of your wellness, this is worth considering. It’s stylish enough for work and everyday wear and possesses thoughtful design details and health tracking features other hybrid smartwatch competitors don’t.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Vivomove HR</li><li>Product Brand  Garmin</li><li>Price  $300.00</li><li>Release Date  August 2017</li><li>Color  Gold</li><li>Platform  Garmin OS</li><li>Battery capacity  Up to 5 days in smartwatch mode</li><li>Water resistance  5 ATM</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-identifying-unresponsiveness-signs-someone-has-blocked-on-snapchat/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Identifying Unresponsiveness Signs Someone Has Blocked on Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-from-ground-to-sky-expert-and-beginners-guide-to-editing-drones/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved From Ground to Sky - Expert and Beginner's Guide to Editing Drones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/establishing-connectivity-how-to-create-a-network-id-for-the-nintendo-3ds/"><u>Establishing Connectivity: How to Create a Network ID for the Nintendo 3DS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-of-srt-unpacking-its-significance-for-2024/"><u>Expert Analysis of SRT Unpacking Its Significance for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/expert-picks-high-performance-cable-modemrouter-duos-dominating-the-market/"><u>Expert Picks: High-Performance Cable Modem/Router Duos Dominating the Market</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-fake-gps-location-apps-on-android-of-your-oppo-find-x7-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, 10 Fake GPS Location Apps on Android Of your Oppo Find X7 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-at-panasonic-hc-wxf991/"><u>In-Depth Look at Panasonic HC-WXF991</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-at-the-ampace-andes-150cu-portable-power-unit-performance-and-convenience-combined/"><u>In-Depth Look at the Ampacē Andes 150Cu Portable Power Unit: Performance and Convenience Combined</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/total-gb-for-24-hour-movie-size/"><u>Total GB for 24-Hour Movie Size</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

They’re big, plastic, white, and take up a lot of space. That’s somewhat mediated by the inclusion of a pass-through electrical socket, which is a really nice touch.</p><p> Due to the size and configuration of these units, they prevent you from plugging certain devices into the free socket in the outlet that the LANSocket 1500 itself is plugged into. For example, you won’t be able to plug some wall-wart power supplies into the open outlet above your LANSocket 1500. You can, however, plug a chunky power supply into the pass-through on the LANSocket 1500 itself.</p><p> The LANSocket 1500 runs on an embedded Linux distribution, which plays a big part in how powerful these adapters really are.</p><p> If you have a 2 gang outlet configuration with four electrical outlets, you’ll find that the LANSocket 1500 blocks the electrical outlet next to it. For that reason, these are best used with standard 1 gang outlets.</p><p> Despite their large size, the LANSocket 1500 adapters are relatively plain in design. They include three indicator lights on the front, an Ethernet jack on the bottom, and a sync button on one side. They also include a lot of vents due to how hot these units tend to run during operation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ahhqweppp7LoE4s2gervkZuyOS8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3LW4141215-04-e086de486a5a4e16ac16cff8ae813b22.jpg"                      alt="Extollo LANSocket 1500 Powerline Adapter Kit"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918703/19272" target="_top" id="1918703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918703/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137229/26400" target="_top" id="2137229">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137229" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137229/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Pain-free-plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Pain-free-plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Pain-free plug and play"></a><strong>Setup Process: Pain-free plug and play</strong></h2><p> Home networking is a complicated subject, but setting up a pair of LANSocket 1500 adapters is about as simple as it gets.

You can then plug each LANSocket 1500 into a handy power outlet.</p><p> At that point, you’re done. The LANSocket 1500 adapters will automatically connect, establish your powerline network, and you’re good to go.

You are very unlikely to see Gigabit speeds, and we certainly didn’t, but the LANSocket 1500 adapters are still quite fast.</p><p> In our testing, we found that the LANSocket matched a wired Ethernet connection to our 300Mbps cable internet connection stride for stride.

Old wiring, damaged wiring, and situations where ground wires aren’t present will all have a negative impact on speeds.

This is something you probably won’t ever have to worry about, since these devices are plug and play without a lot of hassle, but the use of Linux does open up some security holes.</p><p> In order to avoid problems with security, it’s important to plug your LANSocket 1500 adapter into a router that has a built-in firewall instead of directly into your modem. If you plug it into your modem, providing the device with direct access to the internet, you create a situation where someone could connect to the device over the internet and gain access to your network.</p><p> If you plug it into your modem, providing the device with direct access to the internet, you create a situation where someone could connect to the device over the internet and gain access to your network.</p><p> There are additional security precautions that are available to advanced users, like blocking each adapter from accessing the internet directly, but putting a firewalled router between them and your modem is a good first step.</p><p> You can also use the sync button on each LANSocket 1500 adapter to encrypt the data that passes between them, but that prevents you from using any other HomePlug compatible adapters in your network.</p><p> The embedded Linux distro does open up some security concerns, but they can be mostly erased if you connect through a firewalled router. You can find cheaper options, but the bottom line is that you won’t find a cheaper alternative that provides the same high speed, low latency, video buffering, and pass-through socket that you get with the LANSocket 1500.</p><h2 id="Price-Decent-price-for-such-good-performance"><a href="#Price-Decent-price-for-such-good-performance" class="headerlink" title="Price: Decent price for such good performance"></a><strong>Price: Decent price for such good performance</strong></h2><p> The Extollo LANSocket 1500 has an MSRP of $90 for a set of two. That places these adapters right in the same general price range as other similar devices. You can find HomePlug AV2 compatible adapters for a little less, but they typically don’t perform quite as well.</p><p> Since the LANSocket 1500 adapters are so easy to use, and provide such a high level of performance, it’s our judgment that they’re worth the $10 or so premium you’ll typically pay compared to similar competitors.</p><h2 id="Competition-Wins-on-transfer-speeds-with-some-security-concerns"><a href="#Competition-Wins-on-transfer-speeds-with-some-security-concerns" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Wins on transfer speeds with some security concerns"></a><strong>Competition: Wins on transfer speeds with some security concerns</strong></h2><p> The LANSocket 1500 adapters compare very favorably to the competition in terms of transfer speed and latency. They do come with the added concern over security, due to the fact that they run on embedded Linux, but that’s easy enough to deal with if you have a firewalled router.</p><p> The Netgear PowerLINE 1200 is one close competitor that has a list price of $85. It also uses the HomePlug AV2 specification, with theoretical transfer speeds of up to 1200Mbps. In real-world testing, it maxes out at slightly below the LANSocket 1500.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/netgear-powerline-1200-review-4775706" >Netgear Powerline 1200 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Another close competitor that uses the HomePlug AV2 specification, the TP-LINK AV2000, has a theoretical top speed of 2000Mbps despite being limited by a standard Gigabit Ethernet port. While fast, and competitively priced with an MSRP of $90, the TP-Link AV2000 lacks the pass-through electrical outlet you get with the LANSocket 1500.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tp-link-av2000-powerline-adapter-review-4775701" >TP-Link AV2000 Powerline Adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The D-Link Powerline 2000 adapter is another excellent option, which offers higher theoretical speeds, excellent real-world speeds, and a pass-through electrical outlet. It’s also priced a bit higher, with an MSRP of $120.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/d-link-powerline-2000-review-4778144" >D-Link Powerline AV2000 Passthrough DHP-P701AV Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Buy this powerline adapter kit, but secure it behind a firewall.</strong></p><p> The Extollo LANSocket 1500 checks all the right boxes, with some of the highest speeds on the market, a pass-through electrical socket, and a decent price. The high speeds and low latency make this kit a good choice if you need to connect a game console, and the extra memory allowed by the use of Linux really helps out if you stream a lot of video, just be wary of security considerations.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  LANSocket 1500 Powerline Adapter</li><li>Product Brand  Extollo</li><li>UPC  LANSocket 1500</li><li>Price  $89.99</li><li>Weight  7.8 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  2.5 x 1.5 x 4.5 in.</li><li>Warranty  One year parts and labor</li><li>Speed  2Gbps (theoretical)</li><li>Compatibility  HomePlug AV2</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  One</li><li>Chipset  Broadcom BCM60500</li><li>Parental Controls  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-pinnacle-teaser-film-assortment/"><u>[New] Pinnacle Teaser Film Assortment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-cultivating-a-thoughtful-approach-to-youtube-feedback/"><u>[Updated] Cultivating a Thoughtful Approach to YouTube Feedback</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-visuals-tips-for-shooting-and-editing-slow-motion-content-on-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing Visuals Tips for Shooting and Editing Slow Motion Content on Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-the-art-of-soundtrack-posts-a-copyright-primer-for-insta-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Mastering the Art of Soundtrack Posts A Copyright Primer for Insta for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/2024-camera-picks-for-instant-photos-on-a-shoestring/"><u>2024 Camera Picks for Instant Photos on a Shoestring</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/fix-non-functional-dts-truehd-and-e628-drivers-on-windows-after-failed-upgrade-now-solved/"><u>Fix Non-Functional DTS TrueHD and E628 Drivers on Windows After Failed Upgrade - Now Solved!✅</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/forgot-apple-iphone-se-backup-password-heres-what-to-do-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Forgot Apple iPhone SE Backup Password?

To help you find the best option for your setup, we’ve researched and tested systems from all the top manufacturers, including Intel, Apple, Asus, and others.</p><p> Our Top Picks</p><p> Best Apple:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/" >Apple M2 Mac Mini at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#toc-best-apple-apple-m2-mac-mini" >Jump to Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Best Mountable:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7010-small-ff/s012dosffusvp" >Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro at Dell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#toc-best-mountable-dell-optiplex-3070-micro" >Jump to Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Best for Gaming:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/" >Origin PC Chronos at Originpc.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#toc-best-for-gaming-origin-pc-chronos" >Jump to Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Best Pocket Performance:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS" >Intel Compute Stick CS125 at Amazon  $330 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#toc-best-pocket-performance-intel-compute-stick-cs125" >Jump to Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Best-Apple"><a href="#Best-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple"></a>Best Apple</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/" >Apple M2 Mac Mini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Pd8O04wozNFrXoZkq9mLvPa70OA=/fit-in/1500x1102/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Apple-Mac-mini-M2-and-M2-Pro-hero-230117-a58d050768ff412bbd48a60747d03a62.jpg" >Mac Mini M2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/" >https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Apple</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/" >View on Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1746353-REG/apple%5Fmmfj3ll%5Fa%5Fmac%5Fmini%5Fwith%5Fm2.html" >View on B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.adorama.com/acmmfj3lla.html" >$599 at Adorama.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Compact form factor</li><li>Lots of configuration options</li><li>Runs up to two 4K displays</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>High base cost</li><li>Upgrades are expensive</li><li>Integrated graphics</li></ul><p> The M2 Mac Mini is a beautiful piece of tech with impressive specifications and a high price tag. Available in various configurations, the Mac Mini comes with one HDMI 2.0 port capable of piping 4K video to your TV, and you can also hook up a second 4K display via one of the included Thunderbolt 4 ports. All models include<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable-817548" >Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for connecting to your home network, and you can even upgrade to 10GB Ethernet and a compatible high-speed network-attached storage (NAS) unit to round out your home theater experience if you like.</p><p> The best thing about the M2 Mac Mini, which makes it so well suited to the role of home theater PC, is the diminutive, unassuming case. This tiny computer is small enough to slide into just about any home theater setup, either alongside or on top of your other components, and the sleek, silver case is unlikely to clash with the rest of your gear.</p><h2 id="Best-Mountable"><a href="#Best-Mountable" class="headerlink" title="Best Mountable"></a>Best Mountable</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7010-small-ff/s012dosffusvp" >Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5Fu8oX3NbKI7TTjmNNZbexFRbMs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/dell-optiplex-3070-desktop-computer---intel-core-i5-9500t---8gb-ram---256gb-ssd---micro-pc-4b06a3eade744016965e6f8bd76ee825.jpg" >Dell OptiPlex 3070 Desktop Computer - Intel Core i5-9500T - 8GB RAM - 256GB SSD - Micro PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7010-small-ff/s012dosffusvp" >https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&amp;publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Foptiplex-7010-small-ff%2Fs012dosffusvp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7010-small-ff/s012dosffusvp" >View on Dell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Lots of mounting options</li><li>Entry unit very affordable</li><li>High performance options</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Mounting brackets cost extra</li><li>Only two high definition video outputs</li><li>No discrete graphics options</li></ul><p> The Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro is an excellent choice if you’re working on a budget and have space constraints. While this unit is small enough to fit into most home theater cabinets and other situations, you can mount it to the back of your VESA-compatible television with an optional bracket. Carefully route short cables behind your television and add a soundbar, and the Dell Optiplex 3070 can form the core of one of the stealthiest<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/separate-components-theater-system-setup-1846358" >home theater systems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The entry-level Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro offers an excellent mix of affordability and performance, with a dual-core Pentium processor, 4GB DDR4 RAM, and a spacious 500 GB hard disk drive, all with a price tag lower than much of the competition. If you need a higher performance option, you can upgrade to a variety of Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 processors, add a 256GB PCIe SSD, add up to 8GB of RAM, and more.</p><p> The only real drawback of the Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro is that there isn’t any option for discrete graphics. If that isn’t important, then this line has much to offer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134221/18498" target="_top" id="2134221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134221/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-Gaming"><a href="#Best-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Best for Gaming"></a>Best for Gaming</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/" >Origin PC Chronos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6QzWM_zWynxfnbYZHsOGPauMkVQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/origin-pc-chronos-8f6801fc035949cda1674983b86c32e2.jpg" >Origin PC Chronos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/" >https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Origin PC</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/" >View on Originpc.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Home theater and gaming in one package</li><li>Fantastic performance for the size</li><li>Some upgrades available</li><li>Compact design</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>No free PCIe slots for upgrades</li><li>No free DIMM slots for more RAM</li><li>Manufacturer add-ons are expensive</li></ul><p> The Origin Chronos is on the larger side of PCs we recommend for home theater settings, but there’s a good reason for the exception. This PC is still significantly smaller than your typical tower unit. Yet, it’s powerful enough to run the 4K display in your home theater system and then seamlessly switch over to play many of the latest games at the highest settings. If you’re a home-theater buff who is also into PC gaming, the Origin Chronos ticks all the right boxes.</p><p> While the Chronos is a bit on the large side, gamers will be immediately comfortable with the size and form factor. It doesn’t conform precisely to the size specifications of any specific game system. Still, it doesn’t look out of place next to an Xbox One or PlayStation 4, nor will it have overstayed its welcome by the time you upgrade to the next generation of consoles.</p><p> The base configuration of the Origin Chronos comes packed with a six-core AMD Ryzen 5 3600 and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super, which means you can even use it with some of the best VR headsets. You can also upgrade to various more powerful<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amd-vs-intel-which-processor-is-best-for-you-4780276" >Intel and AMD Ryzen CPUs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and even slot in a beastly Nvidia GeForce3 RTX Titan if you’re looking to future-proof your home theater and gaming experiences.</p><p> The Origin Chronos is a bit pricey if you’re not looking for a home theater PC that can double as a powerful gaming rig, but it’s a fantastic option if that is what you’re looking for. It even allows you to upgrade after the fact, like a traditional PC. However, the PCIe and DIMM slots are all full from the factory, so you’ll be replacing components with upgrades rather than just adding new functionality on top.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136614/26400" target="_top" id="2136614">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136614" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136614/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Pocket-Performance"><a href="#Best-Pocket-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Best Pocket Performance"></a>Best Pocket Performance</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS" >Intel Compute Stick CS125 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IWj-nLakAVXRcFFnwLZ_74Scfkc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/intel-compute-stick-cs125-computer-with-intel-atom-x5-processor-and-windows-10-boxstk1aw32scblack-3692e45b206b45e08473c04bcb5814d8.jpg" >Intel Compute Stick CS125 Computer with Intel Atom x5 Processor and Windows 10 (BOXSTK1AW32SC),Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS" >$330 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Remarkably small size</li><li>Decent performance</li><li>Affordable</li><li>Full Windows experience</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Limited memory</li><li>Some versions are expensive</li><li>No upgradeability</li><li>Some models are sluggish</li></ul><p> The Intel Compute Stick is a tiny home theater PC with a form factor that isn’t much larger than most television streaming devices. It’s designed to plug directly into one of the HDMI ports on your television, or you can use an HDMI adapter if the Compute Stick is too big.</p><p> Unlike streaming devices with a similar form factor, the Intel Compute Stick is a legitimate Windows PC. It features the whole Windows 10 experience, which means you can use this tiny home theater PC to do anything you can with any other Windows computer. You can install apps, browse the internet, and stream media for your home theater.</p><p> The Intel Compute Stick comes in a few configurations, so choosing the right one is essential. The most affordable option packs a lightweight Atom processor suitable for basic streaming, but don’t expect it to do any heavy lifting. More expensive versions are available with faster processors, all in the same tiny form factor.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-devices-to-buy-for-streaming-tv-4061016" >Streaming Devices <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Home-Theater-PC"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Home-Theater-PC" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Home Theater PC"></a>What to Look For in a Home Theater PC</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080347/19272" target="_top" id="2080347">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080347" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080347/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Processor"><a href="#Processor" class="headerlink" title="Processor"></a>Processor</h3><p> You’ll find home theater PCs equipped with both Intel and AMD CPUs. AMD is a fine choice if you’re after a budget model and don’t need high performance, while Intel typically provides higher performance. The latest AMD processors have flipped that script with a fantastic performance from their most expensive offerings, but you’re unlikely to make that kind of investment in a home theater PC.</p><h3 id="Graphics-Card"><a href="#Graphics-Card" class="headerlink" title="Graphics Card"></a>Graphics Card</h3><p> You need your home theater PC to have a discrete graphics card for the best performance. It doesn’t need to be powerful enough to play the latest games if you aren’t also a gamer, but it does need to be powerful enough to drive an HD or 4K display or multiple displays, depending on your configuration. If budget is more important, you may have to settle for integrated graphics.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130885/7443" target="_top" id="2130885">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130885" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130885/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Storage"><a href="#Storage" class="headerlink" title="Storage"></a>Storage</h3><p> You’ll need plenty of storage to convert your media library to digital content that you can play on your home theater PC or stream to other devices.

It has a wall-plug design yet hits higher speeds than some of the simpler plug-in models out there, however, it isn’t as large as some of the extenders that are nearly as sizable as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-routers-4038590" >routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> themselves.</p><p> It also has advanced technologies such as MU-MIMO and beamforming, so it feels like a fully capable device. You’ll pay a bit more for this one compared to some of the entry-level plug-in Wi-Fi extenders, but if your home is plagued by wireless dead zones or you just want to ensure a more consistent high-speed signal throughout your dwelling, then this is a strong option. I tested the Netgear Nighthawk X4 for several days in my house for a variety of needs, including everyday work, playing online games, and streaming media.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123734/7443" target="_top" id="2123734">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123734" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123734/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Hearty-but-still-compact"><a href="#Design-Hearty-but-still-compact" class="headerlink" title="Design: Hearty, but still compact"></a><strong>Design: Hearty, but still compact</strong></h2><p> At just over 6 inches tall and 3 inches wide, the Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender might look a little too large to hang from a wall outlet, but most of the weight is concentrated at the base where it plugs in. It’ll only take up one plug on an outlet, leaving the other free, and it stayed securely in place during use.</p><p> Netgear opted for an angular approach here with some tapered elements, and most of the sides are covered in tiny air vents to ensure that this powerful little plug-in has the ventilation that it needs. On the front are lights that indicate the strength of the signal and show network activity, as well as power and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wps-4842308" >WPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> switch indicators.</p><p> On the left side are On&#x2F;Off and WPS connectivity buttons, as well as a switch that lets you swap between using the device as an extender (to repeat an existing Wi-Fi signal) or an access point, which would create a wireless network from a plugged-in Ethernet cable from your modem. That<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is on the bottom of the device, and when in the typical extender mode, you can use it to plug in a wired device to access the wireless network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ahWiBPBlk75slmsmgc-c4cnSgf8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkX4_03-6a6cab81b4ec4da39c89aa3a92cb1f16.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X4 (EX7300) Wi-Fi Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Simple-setup-awkward-app"><a href="#Setup-Process-Simple-setup-awkward-app" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Simple setup, awkward app"></a><strong>Setup Process: Simple setup, awkward app</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Netgear Nighthawk X4 essentially means capturing the signal from your Wi-Fi router and then finding an ideal spot to place the extender to bring Wi-Fi into dead zones and areas with an inconsistent signal.</p><p> There are three ways to do this. Starting with the extender plugged in near your router, you can set it up by following the prompts in Netgear’s Nighthawk mobile app for iOS or Android, by doing the same via a web interface on your computer, or by using the WPS button on both the extender and router. The last option is the simplest, as the devices can automatically pair via a button found on the extender and basically any modern router.</p><p> While the setup process is straightforward, the Nighthawk mobile app itself was a bit wonky.</p><p> I set mine up using the iOS app, and while the process is straightforward, the Nighthawk app itself was a bit wonky. I had to try connecting to the router’s setup network several times before it went through, and it just seemed inconsistently responsive throughout. Ultimately, however, I was able to finish the setup process.</p><p> Once that is complete, you can unplug the extender and find a new place for it in your home. Netgear advises placing it about halfway between your router and the dead zone(s) that you’re trying to address, but you may need to play around with positioning based on the design of your home and potential obstructions that could weaken the signal. If you’re not getting the signal boost that you expect, then try another plug location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rfn4cAzCyxeBXmoIx0VVBH7R0w8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkX4_04-188447741dad41d7a4c51fd7c71861f2.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982459">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982459">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982459%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982459/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Steady-stellar-speeds"><a href="#Connectivity-Steady-stellar-speeds" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Steady, stellar speeds"></a><strong>Connectivity: Steady, stellar speeds</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X4 worked as advertised, delivering strong speeds, improving upon the signal available from the router in the further corners of my house, and even holding a 5GHz signal pretty well when a fair distance away from the extender. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >MU-MIMO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (multiple user, multi-in multi-out) design allows for more simultaneous signals while beamforming helps hone a signal towards its requesting device. All told, these technological advancements seem to help deliver strong wireless performance.</p><p> Even though I paired it with a TP-Link router, the Netgear Nighthawk X4 maintained the same network names as my router uses. My smartphone and laptop automatically switched to the stronger signal when plugged in. Beyond the speed difference, I could tell when I plugged in the extender and saw the 5GHz network jump from a steady 2 bars to a full 4 bars once the extender was fully powered on.</p><p> Typically, 2.4GHz networks are slower but offer wider range, while the faster 5GHz networks don’t stretch quite as far. Luckily, the extender helps negate the latter issue and can give you more of that 5GHz speed in more places of your home. In my case, a speed test in my office with the extender in place revealed a download speed of 89Mbps with the 2.4GHz network, but then 203Mbps on the 5GHz network.</p><p> Technological advancements such as MU-MIMO and beamforming seem to help deliver strong wireless performance.</p><p> Distance testing revealed that the 5GHz network continued to provide strong speeds even approximately 75 feet away from the extender. Testing in my extended backyard with just one wall between my laptop and the extender, I saw download speeds of 38Mbps at 25 feet, 27Mbps at 50 feet, and 16Mbps at 75 feet on 2.4GHz. However, the 5GHz network gave me 132Mbps at 25 feet, 81Mbps at 50 feet, and 75Mbps at 75 feet.</p><p> Online gaming was also smooth across the board with the Netgear Nighthawk X4. I saw a typical ping of around 38 with both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz extended networks in Rocket League, and a couple points faster when plugged into the Ethernet port. I played several matches across the configuration options and encountered no sluggishness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ugGkkd4SJutt9ZSqg6hsgakNAAU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkX4_05-8a00f82288884d71bd867f253500e04f.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137378/7443" target="_top" id="2137378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137378/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Price-Worth-the-investment"><a href="#Price-Worth-the-investment" class="headerlink" title="Price: Worth the investment"></a><strong>Price: Worth the investment</strong></h2><p> At an MSRP of $150 but often seen now for $130, the Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender costs a fair bit more than a simpler entry-level extender, but the strong performance—especially on the 5GHz band—makes it a worthy investment if you plan on playing online games or streaming extensive media. There are much cheaper Wi-Fi extenders out there, however (like the one below), if your needs aren’t very extensive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934138/19272" target="_top" id="1934138">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934138" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934138/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-X4-vs-TP-Link-RE200"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-X4-vs-TP-Link-RE200" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk X4 vs. TP-Link RE200"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk X4 vs. TP-Link RE200</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tp-link-re200wi-fi-range-extender-review-4846136" >TP-Link’s RE200 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view at<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/42300087" >Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is similar in its plug-in approach, but it’s much smaller and costs a fraction of the price at $30. It also gave me solid connectivity on 2.4GHz, although the 5GHz performance left something to be desired.</p><p> The other annoyance was the fact that it creates separate wireless networks for the extender if you don’t have one of the recent, compatible TP-Link routers. That can cause headaches with needing to switch between networks based on where you are in your home. On the other hand, it’s $30. If you just want to push your Wi-Fi into an additional room or two for web browsing and Netflix, then don’t feel obligated to spend $100+ on an extender.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A strong mid-range Wi-Fi extender.</strong></p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender finds a pretty ideal middle ground in the Wi-Fi extender market, delivering a strong performance that’s better than what you’ll likely get from a cheap, entry-level extender.

Let’s Examine"></a>Is Walmart+ The Answer to Affordable Shopping? Let’s Examine</h2><p> Walmart Plus provides several benefits to Walmart shoppers, including<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/get-free-shipping-every-time-you-shop-1356419" >free shipping <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the Walmart website and free<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-walmart-grocery-app-4176295" >grocery delivery from your local Walmart store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If you’re unsure whether you need it, this guide will provide you with all the details you need to make an informed decision.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-Walmart-Plus"><a href="#What-Is-Walmart-Plus" class="headerlink" title="What Is Walmart Plus?"></a>What Is Walmart Plus?</h2><p> Walmart Plus is a subscription service that provides membership benefits to Walmart shoppers along with a handful of other freebies and perks. The primary benefit of Walmart Plus is free shipping with no minimum order totals. That includes free same-day shipping and grocery delivery from local Walmart stores, and it also has other freebies, perks, and limited-time offers.</p><p> Here’s what you get with Walmart Plus:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Free shipping</strong> : Members receive free shipping on Walmart.com orders without minimum order totals. Delivery times vary depending on location, but some items arrive the same day or the next day if available from a local Walmart store. Most shipped items come in two to three days. In-home returns are also available with some restrictions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Grocery delivery</strong> : If you live within range of a Walmart, you can take advantage of free grocery delivery. Express delivery requires an extra fee, but deliveries scheduled three or more hours in advance are free.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discounted gas</strong> : Members receive a $0.10 per gallon discount at Exxon and Mobil stations, up to $0.10 off at some Walmart and Murphy gas stations, and member pricing at Sam’s Club fuel centers without needing a Sam’s Club membership. To receive these discounts, you need to use the Walmart app.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scan &amp; Go</strong> : This in-store feature speeds up the checkout process. It allows you to use the Walmart app on your phone to scan items as you shop, scan a QR code at the self-checkout kiosk, and then pay using your phone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Streaming services</strong> : Walmart Plus doesn’t have its own streaming service, but members receive a free Paramount+ Essential plan subscription.</p></li><li><p><strong>Exclusive offers</strong> : Members can access limited-time special offers for free or discounted services.</p></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130871/7443" target="_top" id="2130871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-You-Should-Get-Walmart-Plus"><a href="#Why-You-Should-Get-Walmart-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Why You Should Get Walmart Plus"></a>Why You Should Get Walmart Plus</h2><p> Walmart Plus is primarily valuable for frequent Walmart shoppers. Consider signing up for Walmart Plus if you:</p><ul><li>Frequently purchase items from the Walmart website.</li><li>Buy your groceries and other items from Walmart.</li><li>Often use Walmart’s self-checkout kiosks and want a faster experience.</li><li>Want a grocery delivery service.</li><li>Don’t already participate in a gas discount program, or you’re currently saving less than $0.10 per gallon.</li></ul><h2 id="When-You-Shouldn’t-Get-Walmart-Plus"><a href="#When-You-Shouldn’t-Get-Walmart-Plus" class="headerlink" title="When You Shouldn’t Get Walmart Plus"></a>When You Shouldn’t Get Walmart Plus</h2><p> Walmart Plus isn’t for everyone. Here are some reasons you might want to skip this subscription:</p><ul><li>You aren’t interested in shopping on the Walmart website.</li><li>You don’t buy groceries or other items at Walmart.</li><li>There aren’t any Walmart stores in your area.</li><li>You already use another grocery delivery service like Instacart or DoorDash.</li><li>You already participate in a gas discount program that saves you $0.10 or more per gallon.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148637/16836" target="_top" id="2148637">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148637" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148637/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-You-Should-Sign-Up-For-Walmart-Plus"><a href="#Why-You-Should-Sign-Up-For-Walmart-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Why You Should Sign Up For Walmart Plus"></a>Why You Should Sign Up For Walmart Plus</h2><p> Walmart Plus includes many valuable benefits for frequent Walmart shoppers, and you may even find it worthwhile to switch to shopping at Walmart if you have one nearby. Here are the main reasons you might want to consider signing up.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037359/7443" target="_top" id="2037359">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037359" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037359/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="You’re-Tired-of-Minimum-Order-Requirements"><a href="#You’re-Tired-of-Minimum-Order-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="You’re Tired of Minimum Order Requirements"></a>You’re Tired of Minimum Order Requirements</h3><p> Walmart Plus does away with adding small items to your cart just to hit that minimum order total for free shipping. Subscribers don’t have any minimum order amount, so you can buy whatever you want, whenever you want, without worrying about shipping costs. Most items arrive within two or three days; some are available with same or next-day delivery from your local store. You can also take advantage of in-home returns, where Walmart will send a driver to pick up items that you want to return, with some limitations and restrictions.</p><h3 id="Walmart-Is-Your-Primary-Grocery-Store"><a href="#Walmart-Is-Your-Primary-Grocery-Store" class="headerlink" title="Walmart Is Your Primary Grocery Store"></a>Walmart Is Your Primary Grocery Store</h3><p> If Walmart is your primary grocery store, or you’re willing to switch, you’ll get a lot of use out of Walmart Plus. Members enjoy free same-day grocery delivery, with the option to pay a small fee for express delivery within one to three hours. Grocery pickup is also available for no extra charge. You can also have other Walmart items delivered along with your groceries or included in your pickup order, like electronics, clothes, and other products.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151870/7443" target="_top" id="2151870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="You-Want-a-Faster-In-store-Checkout-Experience"><a href="#You-Want-a-Faster-In-store-Checkout-Experience" class="headerlink" title="You Want a Faster In-store Checkout Experience"></a>You Want a Faster In-store Checkout Experience</h3><p> If you’re an in-store Walmart shopper, Walmart Plus provides a faster checkout option called Scan &amp; Go. This speedy checkout method allows you to scan items with the Walmart app on your phone while shopping so that everything is ready to go when you arrive at the self-checkout station. There’s no need to scan the items again using the self-checkout station; you can even pay using your phone.</p><p>LordHenriVoton &#x2F; iStock &#x2F; Getty Images</p><h3 id="You’re-Looking-For-a-Good-Fuel-Rewards-Program"><a href="#You’re-Looking-For-a-Good-Fuel-Rewards-Program" class="headerlink" title="You’re Looking For a Good Fuel Rewards Program"></a>You’re Looking For a Good Fuel Rewards Program</h3><p> Walmart Plus provides a hefty $0.10 per gallon discount on gas at Mobil and Exxon stations and many Walmart gas stations, and it also provides you with member pricing at Sam’s Club fueling stations even if you don’t have a Sam’s Club membership. Some fuel reward programs offer steeper discounts but are usually complicated and require you to go to specific locations for the best pricing. Walmart Plus gives you a large flat discount, so it’s easier to use.</p><h2 id="When-You-Shouldn’t-Sign-Up-For-Walmart-Plus"><a href="#When-You-Shouldn’t-Sign-Up-For-Walmart-Plus" class="headerlink" title="When You Shouldn’t Sign Up For Walmart Plus"></a>When You Shouldn’t Sign Up For Walmart Plus</h2><p> Walmart Plus can provide a lot of value, but only if you can take advantage of all the benefits. Here are some of the reasons you might want to skip this subscription:</p><h3 id="You-Don’t-Shop-at-Walmart"><a href="#You-Don’t-Shop-at-Walmart" class="headerlink" title="You Don’t Shop at Walmart"></a>You Don’t Shop at Walmart</h3><p> Walmart Plus has a lot of valuable benefits, but the primary reason to sign up is to save money on shipping and grocery delivery fees. If you don’t buy a lot from the Walmart website and don’t get your groceries from Walmart, then you’re unlikely to recoup your investment. It’s difficult to recommend Walmart Plus to anyone who already has a subscription to a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/popular-food-delivery-service-apps-3485970" >grocery delivery service <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-does-instacart-work-4783870" >Instacart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-does-doordash-work-4584150" >DoorDash <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> unless you’re interested in switching because there’s too much overlap.</p><h3 id="There-Aren’t-Any-Walmarts-In-Your-Area"><a href="#There-Aren’t-Any-Walmarts-In-Your-Area" class="headerlink" title="There Aren’t Any Walmarts In Your Area"></a>There Aren’t Any Walmarts In Your Area</h3><p> If you don’t have a Walmart nearby, you’ll unlikely get the most out of a Walmart Plus subscription. You may recoup your investment if you buy a lot of stuff from the Walmart website, especially if you tend to make many small purchases that don’t meet the minimum order requirement for free shipping, but it’s less likely. If you don’t have a local Walmart, you won’t be able to take advantage of same-day delivery, free grocery delivery, or the in-store Scan &amp; Go system.</p><h3 id="You-Already-Have-a-Good-Fuel-Discount-Program"><a href="#You-Already-Have-a-Good-Fuel-Discount-Program" class="headerlink" title="You Already Have a Good Fuel Discount Program"></a>You Already Have a Good Fuel Discount Program</h3><p> If you already have a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gas-apps-5323703" >fuel rewards program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that provides a discount of at least $0.10 per gallon, then you’re unlikely to get a lot of use out of this part of Walmart Plus. There’s still some value in getting access to membership pricing at Sam’s Club if you have one nearby and don’t have a Sam’s Club membership, but it’s unlikely to be enough to warrant signing up.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918684/19272" target="_top" id="1918684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918684/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Walmart-vs-Amazon-Prime"><a href="#Walmart-vs-Amazon-Prime" class="headerlink" title="Walmart+ vs. Amazon Prime"></a>Walmart+ vs. Amazon Prime</h2><p> Walmart Plus has drawn comparisons to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-4155327" >Amazon Prime <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because they’re both membership programs offered by online retail giants, but they’re very different services that offer different things.  </p><p> While Amazon Prime is more expensive than Walmart Plus, it includes free two-day shipping with one-day and same-day shipping in some areas, a streaming service with thousands of TV shows and movies through<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-video-4176363" >Prime Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , access to e-books through<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-reading-4160132" >Prime Reading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , photo storage through<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/using-amazon-photos-5216187" >Amazon Photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and exclusive member savings at Whole Foods grocery stores. If you’re primarily interested in shopping online and streaming movies and TV shows, Amazon Prime is a better deal, even at a higher price.</p><p> Walmart Plus provides some of those benefits but in different ways. You get free three-day shipping, with many items shipping in two days or even arriving the same day for locally available items. You also get free grocery delivery and pickup from your local Walmart store, a more convenient way to check out when shopping at your local Walmart, and gas discounts at Exxon, Mobile, and Walmart gas stations. Walmart Plus doesn’t have a streaming service like Amazon Prime, but membership comes with free access to Paramount Plus. Walmart Plus is still primarily for frequent Walmart shoppers, though.</p><h2 id="Do-You-Need-Walmart-Plus-to-Shop-at-Walmart"><a href="#Do-You-Need-Walmart-Plus-to-Shop-at-Walmart" class="headerlink" title="Do You Need Walmart Plus to Shop at Walmart?"></a>Do You Need Walmart Plus to Shop at Walmart?</h2><p> You don’t need Walmart Plus to shop at Walmart, but it is worth considering if you’re a frequent Walmart shopper. While it is a membership plan, it offers no in-store discounts. It does provide free shipping with no minimum order requirements, though, with many items available the same day. It’s also a good deal if you typically get groceries through Walmart or are interested in a grocery delivery service and don’t already have one.
