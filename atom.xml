Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> If you use your laptop for playing games or running high-performance apps, then you’ve probably seen it get very warm and kick on its potentially loud internal fans. However, the built-in fans can only do so much to dissipate the immense heat built within, try as they might. That’s where laptop cooling pads come in, blasting additional cool air into your laptop to help take down the internal and external temperatures.</p><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops.</p><p> Kootek’s Laptop Cooling Pad isn’t the cheapest option around, nor is it the most premium—but it’s effective and sells for a reasonable price, and is large enough to accommodate larger laptops with 17-inch displays. A clunky height adjustment system is the main drawback, but it doesn’t stop the Kootek pad from working as expected.</p><h2 id="Design-Clunky-but-it-works"><a href="#Design-Clunky-but-it-works" class="headerlink" title="Design: Clunky, but it works"></a>Design: Clunky, but it works</h2><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a larger unit, measuring nearly 15 inches wide, 11.8 inches tall, and about 1.4 inches thick, with a weight of 2.6 pounds. It’s heavier and bulkier than the lightweight TopMate C302 Cooling Pad, for example, and feels more durable as a result.</p><p> It’s built for laptops with screens between 12 and 17 inches diagonal, with a wide metal grate on the surface to help dissipate heat as the five fans blow onto your laptop. Most of the rest of the build is plastic. Each fan has red LED lighting for an added glow to the pad.</p><p> The height adjustment system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution.</p><p> Two flip-up, padded stoppers at the bottom of the surface help keep your laptop in place even when you have the pad angled, thanks to the height adjustment system. Granted, that system is easily my least favorite part of this cooling pad.</p><p> Essentially, there’s a loose metal bar hanging from the main unit of the cooling pad, and you’ll slot that into one of six ridges on the bottom stand to prop it up. The system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution. It works and it provides finer-grain height adjustment levels, but it feels like a clunky solution for a tech accessory.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36506229&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><video width="100%" height="" class="rounded-t-md shadow-lg relative z-20" controls="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" webkit-playinginline=""></p><source type="video/mp4" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.mp4"><source type="video/webm" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.webm"></video></a><!-- affiliate ads end -->![Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6Uuby879oWyaUH6_3WN7ZssAF-g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_04-73dc23f85de34fa087b21b21461f9f74.jpg)<p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> There are two buttons at the back of the pad: One button controls the large, central fan (4.72 inches), while the other controls the four smaller fans (2.76 inches each). I’m not sure why you would choose to use only some fans at any given time, since they’re all quiet, but the option is there if you want it. You’ll also find two USB-A ports, meaning this cooling pad functions as a hub for plugging additional accessories into your laptop.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Very-straightforward"><a href="#Setup-Process-Very-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Very straightforward"></a>Setup Process: Very straightforward</h2><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad doesn’t require any software or its own power unit to function. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the height as desired, and then plug the built-in USB cable into your laptop to power it on. As mentioned, you can control the fans using the buttons at the back of the pad, and the USB ports can be used for additional accessories.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A5iJ3c7mD8guT4DKXitqb3wlp6I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_03-9ec8e6afd494441f8ae20c38ae1fadbb.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Performance-Cool-and-quiet"><a href="#Performance-Cool-and-quiet" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Cool and quiet"></a>Performance: Cool and quiet</h2><p> I tested the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad with the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , featuring an Intel Core i7-9750H processor with 16GB RAM, along with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (6GB). It’s a solidly powerful gaming laptop, and I put it to the test with a couple of popular games as well as a graphics benchmark test.</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid impact in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite.</p><p> I recorded the internal temperature using NZXT’s CAM app and the external temperature with a infrared thermometer, first with the laptop by itself. After it cooled down, I tested again with the cooling pad equipped the whole time.</p><p> In racing game Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade put up an internal processor temperature of 184 degrees Fahrenheit and external temperature of 117 degrees, but peaked at 169 degrees internal and 107 degrees external with the Kootek pad equipped. The average frame rate was nearly identical between tests, with no significant difference from the use of the cooling pad.</p><p> Meanwhile, I saw a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees when playing Fortnite, along with an external temperature of 118 degrees. With the cooling pad equipped, I saw a slightly lower internal peak of 192 degrees, although it mostly hovered in the 160 to 170-degree range during testing. The external peak with the Kootek pad was 106 degrees. Curiously, I saw the exact same numbers with the Heaven graphics benchmark test with and without the cooling pad: 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees external.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ppFnQ9kEpjbEV9cYbHzLRI5j-j8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_05-4a4d5ee065a94c3e984ae0c96f4916d8.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid effort in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite, although the cheaper, dual-fan TopMate C302 cooling pad saw slightly better overall results. Your experience may vary depending on your laptop of choice, however. All the while, the Kootek pad stayed pretty quiet in stark contrast to the Razer Blade’s own very loud internal fans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713565&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Mac： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Entirely-reasonable"><a href="#Price-Entirely-reasonable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Entirely reasonable"></a>Price: Entirely reasonable</h2><p> At $26 from Amazon, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops.

It’s designed for laptops up to 15 inches in size and isn’t quite as thick or heavy, but it gets the job done with effective cooling and straightforward design. Kootek’s pad offers an additional USB port for accessories, though, and allows for more height variance than the TopMate’s basic pop-out feet.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A good all-around option.</strong></p><p> A clunky design makes the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad a bit awkward in use, but ultimately it does a solid job of cooling hot laptops and accommodating larger-sized devices. The extra USB ports are handy, especially for port-limited laptops, and the price is reasonable.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"

Your standard GPS tracker can keep up with the location of the unit, but OBD-II port trackers have other added features that can help you better understand your driving habits and even notify you of what’s wrong when the dreaded Check Engine light comes on.</p><p> For this review, we’re taking a look at the Bouncie GPS Tracker, a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-3g-3426465" >3G <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> tracker that plugs directly into your vehicle’s OBD-II port and helps keep track of both your habits and location with the help of an accompanying smartphone app. I’ve spent more than 60 hours of driving testing this unit and have summarized my thoughts in the sections below.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Pretty-typical"><a href="#Design-Pretty-typical" class="headerlink" title="Design: Pretty typical"></a><strong>Design: Pretty typical</strong></h2><p> The Bouncie is fairly standard as far as the design goes. Like many other OBD-II port trackers and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/diagnostic-tools-for-car-534864" >diagnostic tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it features a rectangular design with your standard trapezoid section for the device to plug into your vehicle’s OBD-II port. Aside from that, there’s nothing to mention because the device is mostly set it and forget it.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Straight-to-the-point"><a href="#Setup-Process-Straight-to-the-point" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Straight to the point"></a><strong>Setup Process: Straight to the point</strong></h2><p> Unlike so many other GPS trackers I’ve tested, setting up Bouncie was a breeze. After removing the device from the box, it’s as simple as downloading the accompanying application (Android, iOS) and following the included instructions to get the device on and connected. After your Bouncie account has been created, simply subscribe to the service (either online or via in-app purchase) and you’re on your way to keeping tabs on your vehicle. From beginning to end the process couldn’t have taken me more than 10 minutes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718728&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Basic HD - Software based live production. vMix Basic HD includes 4 inputs, 3 cameras, streaming, recording, playlist.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-and-Software-Helpful-and-intuitive"><a href="#Performance-and-Software-Helpful-and-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Performance and Software: Helpful and intuitive"></a><strong>Performance and Software: Helpful and intuitive</strong></h2><p> Despite being a compact device, Bounce has managed to pack a good bit of technology inside. In addition to a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-sim-cards-577532" >pre-installed SIM card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Bouncie unit has integrated GPS, a 3-axis accelerometer, a tamper-detection system and the ability to read out engine codes to output to your mobile device when the ‘check engine’ light comes on.</p><p> Despite much of this technology being relatively new, the OBD port connector means any car built during1996 or later can make use of the Bouncie unit, effectively turning it into a smart car, of sorts.</p><p> Bouncie and its accompanying application record every trip you take, updating the vehicle’s location every 15 seconds. My testing confirmed the refresh rate to be as advertised, even in areas where cellular reception was less than ideal. The Bouncie app uses<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-google-maps-4799052" >Google Maps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as the underlying mapping data, which not only provides some of the most up-to-date information but also allows for detailed satellite views when tracking your vehicle. Additional mapping features include the ability to add geo-circles for location-specific notifications when a vehicle leaves or enters a specific geographic area. Setting these areas within the app is as simple as dragging a circle over the area you want to be monitored and setting up the parameters as you see fit.</p><p> Bouncie and its accompanying application record every trip you take, updating the vehicle’s location every 15 seconds.</p><p> It’s not just your location the Bouncie keeps track of though. The device also uses its diagnostics capabilities and accelerometer to keep track of the vehicle’s driving habits. From rapid accelerations to hard braking detection and even idle time, the Bouncie tracks it all to give you detailed information on how well (or poorly) you’re driving your vehicle.</p><p> One of my favorite features of the Bouncie unit is its ability to read out diagnostic trouble codes (DTC). If you don’t know what those are, they’re little strings of letters and numbers that correlate to various sensors and functions within your vehicle. More often than not, one of these codes being thrown by your vehicle results in the dreaded Check Engine light that pops on when something goes wrong.</p><p> One of my favorite features of the Bouncie unit is its ability to read out diagnostic trouble codes (DTC).</p><p> Usually, these codes need to be read by a mechanic with a special device, but the Bouncie makes it easy to see these codes directly on your mobile device, going so far as to summarize what the problem is, rather than simply listing the code being thrown. This feature can be very helpful if you’re trying to figure out what’s wrong when your Check Engine light comes on. Some vehicles even offer fuel-reporting so you know exactly how much fuel is in your tank, rather than relying on only the gauge on your dash.</p><p> Overall, the device performs well in tracking and does a fantastic job keeping tabs on your driving habits, for better or worse.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Price-Incredible-value"><a href="#Price-Incredible-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Incredible value"></a><strong>Price: Incredible value</strong></h2><p> At $67 on Amazon, the Bouncie is right down the middle as far as OBD-II GPS trackers go. There are options twice its price and options about half its price, but where the Bouncie stands out is in its subscription service. Unlike other platforms that sometimes require contracts or expensive cellular plans, the Bouncie is a flat $8 every month. There isn’t even an activation charge, which is, unfortunately, something I can’t say for many other GPS units. This not only simplifies the subscription process but also means the long-term cost of the Bouncie is quite lower than its contemporaries.</p><h2 id="Bouncie-Driving-Connected-vs-Spectrum-Smart-GPS-Tracker"><a href="#Bouncie-Driving-Connected-vs-Spectrum-Smart-GPS-Tracker" class="headerlink" title="Bouncie Driving Connected vs. Spectrum Smart GPS Tracker"></a><strong>Bouncie Driving Connected vs. Spectrum Smart GPS Tracker</strong></h2><p> While there’s no shortage of GPS trackers on the market, finding a direct competitor for the Bouncie is a little more challenging, as its monthly subscription cost is much lower than most other options on the market. One tracker, in particular, came pretty close to matching the Bouncie, both in upfront costs and long-term costs when the subscription is taken into account—the Spectrum Smart GPS Tracker (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CVG66SF/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5077523%7Cn14e52bb9be0a45cf89db6079dd0cc1a004%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).</p><p> The Spectrum tracker retails for $70, matching the Bouncie tracker, and its cancel anytime subscription plan costs just $10&#x2F;month (compared to the $8&#x2F;month the Bouncie tracker costs). Aside from price, it offers nearly identical specifications to the Bouncie tracker, includes faster 4G LTE connectivity, instant alerts, and trip overview modes for keeping tabs on the vehicle it’s plugged into. It is worth noting though that the Spectrum app does appear to be less polished than the Bouncie app and as of publishing this review, it’s been a few months since it’s been updated on both Android and iOS.</p><p> While the Spectrum tracker is a decent alternative, the Bouncie does appear to be the more compelling offer, with a slightly more affordable subscription plan and a more intuitive application that the Bouncie developers keep up to date.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Sweet and simple GPS tracker to make your car smarter.</strong></p><p> Overall, the Bouncie Driving Connected is one of the nicest GPS trackers I’ve tested. It comes in at a decent price point, offers a simple (and relatively affordable) subscription option, and its accompanying mobile apps are well-designed and consistently updated. The fact it can also relay vehicle error codes is a welcomed bonus that further propels it to the top of our favorites list.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  GPS Tracker</li><li>Product Brand  Bouncie</li><li>UPC  B07H8NS5MS</li><li>Price  $67.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.9 x 1.75 x 1 in.</li><li>Connection Type  3G, GPS</li><li>Connectivity Options  OBD-II</li><li>Warranty  One year warranty on the device</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-advanced-tips-for-effective-mobile-video-capture/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Advanced Tips for Effective Mobile Video Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-essential-10-drone-powerhouses-for-industrial-use/"><u>[Updated] Essential 10 Drone Powerhouses for Industrial Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/5-techniques-to-transfer-data-from-nokia-c22-to-iphone-15141312-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>5 Techniques to Transfer Data from Nokia C22 to iPhone 15/14/13/12 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/1722781585364-a-guide-to-economic-warfare-and-empire-expansion-in-offworld-trading-company-insights-from-a-veteran-player/"><u>A Guide to Economic Warfare and Empire Expansion in Offworld Trading Company: Insights From a Veteran Player</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/a-minimalists-take-ufos-deciphered-by-aminy/"><u>A Minimalist's Take: UFOs Deciphered by Aminy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/apples-compact-marvel-in-depth-analysis-of-the-ipad-mini-5/"><u>Apple's Compact Marvel: In-Depth Analysis of the iPad Mini 5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/1722776264700-approach-recall-the-imaging-techniques-mentioned-and-their-sensitivity-to-changes-in-bone/"><u>Approach: Recall the Imaging Techniques Mentioned and Their Sensitivity to Changes in Bone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/best-iphones-for-hardcore-mobile-game-playing/"><u>Best iPhones for Hardcore Mobile Game Playing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/canons-small-giant-an-in-depth-look-at-sx740-hs/"><u>Canon's Small Giant: An In-Depth Look at SX740 HS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/clash-of-titans-a-comprehensive-look-at-the-differences-between-iphone-15-pro-max-and-samsung-s24-ultra/"><u>Clash of Titans: A Comprehensive Look at the Differences Between iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung S24 Ultra</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/connect-and-enjoy-the-lihan-lhfm1039-bluetooth-transmitter-for-a-wireless-hands-free-driving-setup-review/"><u>Connect and Enjoy -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re considering leveling up to a wristwatch that can do more than tell time, but want the look and feel of a typical watch, you may be interested in a hybrid smartwatch. The Withings Move falls right into this group of devices that have more capability than a regular watch and still look like a classic timepiece. It offers fitness tracking but doesn’t require you to be plugged in at all times like most smartwatches.</p><p> We tested the Withings Move to see how comfortable it is for everyday use and explore the extent of its smartwatch characteristics.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SRCqvDOet8fouJ8uY8ze0LlCiog=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-2-1fdc9f06eb6a45f2baa2b840822fba5d.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Slim-and-clean"><a href="#Design-Slim-and-clean" class="headerlink" title="Design: Slim and clean"></a><strong>Design: Slim and clean</strong></h2><p> We don’t typically think of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as being nearly weightless, but the Withings Move is just that. Weighing in at just a little over one ounce, this watch is almost undetectable on the wrist.</p><p> That’s because there’s nothing really heavy in the construction of the device. The back of the face is made of stainless steel, but the case protecting the face is plastic. The lack of weight is nice, but the plastic coupled with the somewhat-flimsy silicone band gives the watch a less refined feel. An added boost to the slim profile is the water-resistance of up to 50 meters, but that seems like a contradiction given the lack of ruggedness in the design.</p><p> Weighing in at just a little over one ounce, this watch is almost undetectable on the wrist.</p><p> At first glance, it looks like your average sporty analog watch. But it’s easy to spot the hint that this device has more functionality. In addition to the usual time and second hands, the Withings Move also features a smaller subdial. This section is labeled from 0-100, and this is where your step goal progress is measured (by percent of completion).</p><p> As far as buttons go, there’s only one, and it’s in the usual spot on the right side of the watch face. It’s not used for winding, though. This is the button you’ll rely on for shutting off the alarm function and starting&#x2F;stopping a workout session.</p><p> Depending on the category you fall into, the lack of a touchscreen could be the largest benefit or drawback of the design. Users who want the look of a regular analog watch will be pleased by the lack of a typical smartwatch screen on their wrist.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35504869&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/1_FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro Annually -  Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Qz1dlsE8jl99mXc7-kQ5LCVoiK0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-3-b1e97631284d40829bd5714c59dc5f2a.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-As-easy-as-1-2-3"><a href="#Setup-Process-As-easy-as-1-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :As easy as 1-2-3"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>As easy as 1-2-3</strong></h2><p> Given such a simple and clean design, it’s natural to expect the setup process to be the same. We found that to be the case.</p><p> The Withings Move comes with no chargers, cables, or ports of any kind, so there’s no charging required out of the box. All the work is done through the complementary Health Mate app, which we downloaded from the App Store.</p><p> The first thing we had to do was sign up for an account in order to move forward with the installation. After we did that, most of the steps took just a few seconds or up to a minute at the longest.</p><p> First, we paired the Withings Move with our phone via Bluetooth, which was instantaneous. Next, we provided profile information for better activity metrics, downloaded an update, made sure the watch dials were working and the time was set correctly, and we were good to go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2337838&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzZwphIv4RM" title="APFill - Ink and Toner Coverage Calculator" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Light-as-a-feather-even-while-sleeping"><a href="#Comfort-Light-as-a-feather-even-while-sleeping" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Light as a feather, even while sleeping"></a><strong>Comfort: Light as a feather, even while sleeping</strong></h2><p> Some watches can feel heavy by the end of the day, but we didn’t encounter that weighed-down feeling with the Withings Move. The watch is really lightweight and the band is soft, flexible, and slim, which made sleeping with it a non-issue. It was also easy to achieve a good fit—especially for smaller wrists—thanks to the plentiful notches and the tab to keep the band in place.</p><p> The Withings Move is not a flashy device with lots of buttons. The button on the side is only used to silence the alarm you set through the app or to initiate an activity session. Because of the comfort and the sleek look, it’s definitely versatile enough to wear on a daily basis. It doesn’t scream “sport watch,” but it’s also not overly decorative, offering an appealing mid-way point between sporty and dressy.</p><p> We did notice that both the front and back of the watch face scratched easily over the course of a week, and suspect this could be a bigger issue for those who are harder on their accessories.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4693127&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videosoftdev.com/images/video_editor/screenshots/1.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>VSDC Pro Video Editor is a light professional non-linear video editing suite for creating a movie of any complexity.

Some activities are automatically recorded: walking, running, hiking, and swimming. With outdoor exercising, you can also track distance and elevation with the connected GPS feature.</p><p> There’s also support for all kinds of other general fitness activities like indoor cycling, weight training, and pilates. All you have to do to log these exercises is to wear the device and launch a workout session by holding the button on the watch for a second or two until it vibrates. That’s the same action for stopping the workout, too.</p><p> It offers fitness tracking but doesn’t require you to be plugged in at all times like most smartwatches.</p><p> Most activities allow you to track your speed, activity length and type, steps taken, and calories burned. You won’t be able to monitor active heart rate for any activity, though. And swimming is even more limited: you can only track how long you’ve swum and the calories exerted. The big bottom line to remember, however, is for any distance-based activity you want to log, you’ll need your smartphone.</p><p> We took the Withings Move (and our smartphone) on a run and a walk, and just like it says it will, the watch automatically detected our activity. When we compared it with our usual step trackers, a Garmin 35 and the iHealth app, steps were comparable. For running activity, we were pleasantly surprised to see that the pace was pretty much spot on. But we missed having information about overall pace, cadence, active heart rate, and distance indicators on the watch face itself.</p><p> We also tested the water-resistance while washing dishes and in the shower. The Withings Move is water-resistant up to 50 meters, which, according to the manufacturer, makes it acceptable for lap swimming, splashing, and dishwashing. Even though we didn’t put it to the depth test, it held up to submersion in soapy water and never missed a beat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vaUmI1isQP98tmL8uIZSghmAWGs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-6-259d8034cfb64485be60f9c5754fec79.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Battery-Long-lasting-and-hassle-free"><a href="#Battery-Long-lasting-and-hassle-free" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Long-lasting and hassle-free"></a><strong>Battery: Long-lasting and hassle-free</strong></h2><p> The Withings Move is reported to have a battery life of up to 18 months, and we really enjoyed that aspect over the week we tested it. Unlike typical smartwatches, we didn’t have to worry about draining the battery and recharging. The internal battery is a typical replaceable watch battery, and the user guide offers directions for removal and replacement when the time comes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/02bkMrpkzqBOue1ffhHNfQqaIuk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-4-df866fafd70a44c592e0e06e0ea53ae7.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Software-An-emphasis-on-general-wellness"><a href="#Software-An-emphasis-on-general-wellness" class="headerlink" title="Software: An emphasis on general wellness"></a><strong>Software: An emphasis on general wellness</strong></h2><p> Though activity data is somewhat limited, the Withings Move does offer some other more in-depth insights. Sleep activity, for example, is automatically detected and doesn’t require any other action besides wearing the watch while sleeping. When you wake in the morning, you’ll be able to view your quality of sleep for the previous night based on the number of interruptions, duration, and even depth of sleep. There is a hiccup with this feature, though—we noticed when we took it off at our desk one morning, it seemed to think we had fallen back asleep and continued reading our sleep quality.</p><p> Another tracking perk is the resting heart rate measuring feature. This requires that you give the Health Mate app permission to access your phone camera, but if you do this, simply placing your finger in front of your camera lens enables the app to sense your pulse and turn out a resting heart rate reading. The reading could be quite slow if we didn’t remain entirely still, which is almost impossible to achieve completely.</p><p> But that quirk aside, the heart rate feature is an appealing addition to a device that offers few flourishes. It obviously does require your smartphone, but all activity (which can also be viewed on the web through your Withings account) is closely tethered to your device.</p><p> Despite the lack of a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-touchscreen-4144770" >touchscreen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or dashboard interface on the watch, it was never difficult to sync data with the Health Mate app or view metrics. It’s easy and uncomplicated to use for recording or launching activities—including<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-food-tracker-apps-4172287" >tracking food <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with the MyFitnessPal integration. Since the app is really what provides the “smart” qualities of the device, we hoped it would deliver on that, and it did.</p><p> There are also a number of other supplemental programs you can sign up for through the Health Connect app in order to up your general wellness. Most of these programs, which are free to join, require a specific type of Withings device, but others, like a meditation and pregnancy tracking program, don’t need any additional equipment.</p><h2 id="Price-A-bargain-for-the-value"><a href="#Price-A-bargain-for-the-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: A bargain for the value"></a><strong>Price: A bargain for the value</strong></h2><p> The Withings Move retails for $69.95, which is an attractive and affordable price for a hybrid smartwatch—most competitors tend to be well above $100. While these other models, like the Fossil Harper and Fossil Q Commuter, typically come with more functionality like music storage or streaming, notifications, or taking a picture from your phone, there’s also a bigger price associated with those features.</p><p> Those looking for a dressier and more substantial watch may find these Fossil models to be better alternatives. Other devices that are comparable in price, like the Fitbit Inspire Fitness Tracker, lack the analog watch qualities and look like designated activity trackers. The Withings Move splits the difference at a modest price.</p><h2 id="Withings-Move-vs-Misfit-Phase"><a href="#Withings-Move-vs-Misfit-Phase" class="headerlink" title="Withings Move vs. Misfit Phase"></a><strong>Withings Move vs. Misfit Phase</strong></h2><p> The Misfit Phase is another hybrid smartwatch with a classic wristwatch look, maybe even more so than the Withings Move. Priced at around $175, the Misfit Phase is more expensive, but also comes with a few bonuses that the Withings Move lacks, like text notifications, playing and pausing music on your phone, and also taking selfies.</p><p> On the other hand, the Misfit Phase’s battery life is less impressive (up to six months) and it’s considerably heavier at nearly seven ounces. It also lacks the subdial feature. If you want more impressive looks and some flashier details, you may be happier paying extra for the Misfit Phase. But if you’re a fan of less equipment on your wrist, the Withings Move could satisfy your hybrid smartwatch wishes.</p><p> Are you interested in weighing other hybrid and smartwatch options? Take a look at our roundup of the best smartwatches for women and the best cheap smartwatches.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Best for those who prefer the analog experience.</strong></p><p> The Withings Move is a strong entry-level fitness tracker for the person who wants to track activities without going all-in on a smartwatch. It’s inexpensive, sporty, and subtle, which makes it compelling for those who don’t want to be distracted by notifications and all the hands-on features smartwatches bring to the table.</p><h2

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Everyone loves zombies, but there are so many zombie shooters, it can be hard to tell them apart. But when we played 7 Days to Die, we jumped for joy and grabbed our digital cricket bats, fully prepared to go full Shaun of the Dead on hordes of the undead. A game loosely based around a nuclear fallout that ends with the fall of civilization and the spawning of undead, hungry friends sounds like a good time. Racking up over 500 hours on the game, we’ve tested it across four major alpha updates, taking note of gameplay, plot, ease of use, and price. Read on to find out our thoughts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MW5wYA5ujBjG5LdXn-w9bTJd5WQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-2-a59091cd21c04d99a42270199349fc2a.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-thanks-to-Steam"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-thanks-to-Steam" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy thanks to Steam"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy thanks to Steam</strong></h2><p> 7 Days to Die for PC can be located on Steam, making it easy to set up. It takes a little while to download, but once it boots up, you’re in. You’ll press the “New Game” button and you’ll need to create a new character, which is easy if you choose one of the preset characters from the list. If you’d like to make a unique character, it’s easy with a creation system similar to Skyrim. Everything, down to the very arch on the eyebrows, is customizable.</p><p> One of the nicest aspects about 7 Days is that when you boot up a game, and even after, you have a plethora of options to customize gameplay. Do you want Scavenger (easiest setting) or do you want to play on the hardest settings in which the game actually tells you, “You’re one bad mother!”? Do you want the 24-hour cycle to span 30 minutes or two hours of real time? Do you want zombies to sprint at night? How many zombies do you want in your day 7 horde? These are all great options for creating unique and challenging gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Eq0YCIdbj82yj3lOCWEdZS7jX6w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-4-341174c3997543728bd2b024c6e2a309.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-Open-world-horror-sandbox"><a href="#Plot-Open-world-horror-sandbox" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Open world horror sandbox"></a><strong>Plot: Open world horror sandbox</strong></h2><p> When you first begin gameplay, it takes about 20 seconds for it to boot up, and then you’re gasping, holding your bare hands out before you, drinking in the landscape of one of five biomes: snow, forest, desert, wasteland, and burnt.</p><p> A prompt flashes onto the screen, beginning a brief tutorial on how to address the basics of the game. This tutorial will take you through basic crafting, helping you to craft axes, plant fiber clothing, and wooden weapons like clubs and bows. It also helps direct you to the nearest Traitor Joe’s general store, where you can buy vital supplies and weapons—but sorry, no overnight stays. After you’ve finished the tutorial, you get some skill points to spend on your skills page, we’ll cover that in more detail below.</p><p> You need water and you need to hunt, forage, and scavenge to survive. You will feel the effects of heat as the desert raises your temperature, and you will starve as the snow biome depletes your caloric intake.</p><p> Once you complete the tutorial, it’s an open sandbox sprinkled with horror and survival elements. The game loosely hints of nuclear fallout, but what matters is civilization has recently fallen and you’re the only person alive. Other than that, the world is yours for the conquering. Alpha 17 does have some smaller quests from Traitor Joe’s, like clearing out zombies in a location, or digging up instructions in a marked spot on the map, but overall the goal is survival. Now, this may seem like an easy feat. After all, zombies are shambling, drooling monsters, but 7 Days to Die may surprise you (more on that later).</p><p> The other, titular part of the plot: every seven days, a zombie horde descends upon you. They know your location. They will find you and claw their way to you, and you have to fend yourself and your base from them. As the 7 days pass, they get harder to defeat. Our understanding is that the end goal of 7 Days is to add a story, but right now they’re focused on honing in general gameplay. We hope that the story will be optional since as a survival horror sandbox, it works very well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/U2XChOqkiQvFhP69V0cQ5mYcYME=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-3-d19d9b4d19734cffb022d6e0db90382e.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Could-be-better-but-solid-overall"><a href="#Gameplay-Could-be-better-but-solid-overall" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Could be better, but solid overall"></a><strong>Gameplay: Could be better, but solid overall</strong></h2><p> 7 Days to Die boasts two playable maps: Navezgane, which is a massive square map consisting of five biomes in which you can use the sandbox world to your advantage; and random map generation, which is a map that randomly spawns cities and biomes. The latter is for players who want a greater challenge, as no random map is the same. The former, however, has fun elements like a school, complete with charging football zombies, and a strip club. From these two kinds of maps alone, gameplay can last for hours (as we said, we’ve clocked in 500 hours at this point).</p><p> Zombies are supposed to be shambling, drooling monsters with a penchant for brains. However, in 7 Days, Alpha 17 updated it so that these zombies are intelligent. They know when you’ve crafted and set any traps—and they maneuver around them with ease.</p><p> As we previously mentioned, zombies are supposed to be shambling, drooling monsters with a penchant for brains. However, Alpha 17 updated the game so that these zombies are intelligent. They know when you’ve crafted and set any traps—and they maneuver around them with ease. It’s mildly frustrating when you’re trying to protect your base from them and the developers have amped it up so high that you really struggle to defend your base.</p><p> However, if you like that sort of challenge, then, by all means, club and shoot your way through the horde and have a blast. That said, 7 Days also boasts some really cool zombies which make gameplay unpredictable and unique. These include: screamer zombies, which alert and spawn hordes with a banshee-like shriek; spider zombies, which can climb through your windows for an unexpected evening soiree; and policeman zombies, who are a solid combination reminiscent of the Spitter and Boomer from the Left 4 Dead franchise.</p><p> There’s also a skill tree that grants you improved abilities as you go along. We feel this skill tree is mildly flawed, as they want you to slowly build up levels and restrict important aspects—like the forge and bikes—until level 20. In order to do this, you have to grind your way through hordes, as slaying zombies is the most effective way to gain experience and level up. If this is your preference, then you’ll have a blast with this game. If you prefer building and crafting, then we recommend opting for something like Minecraft or Terraria. One quick note—because this is a work in progress game, Alpha 18 has promised to restructure this, so this could change when the new update drops.</p><p> One more huge perk is that each building in the game is like a mini dungeon. Filled with traps, sleeping zombies, and lots of loot, it’s a great addition to a game that needed a little extra effort to make the game fun and playable. For example, in one home we raided on multiplayer, one of us fell through a weak floorboard and ended up in a room full of zombies. However, the loot in the house—a hunting rifle, with a couple weapons modifications to make stronger weapons—made it fun, unpredictable, and worth the scares.</p><p> Every seven days, a zombie horde descends upon you. They know your location. They will find you and claw their way to you, and you have to fend yourself and your base from them.</p><p> For the most part, the controls are really easily manageable on the PC, consisting of the basic, fairly universal WASD keyboard controls. If you don’t like the WASD controls, it’s also very easy to go in and alter them. We liked the ease of use, as we were able to jump into the two maps the game boasts without a rough start. We also liked that because of the easy controls, it was easy to attack zombies with melee and ranged weapons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O0do2JbbpgP_VF7azi5OhENnDpc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-5-13eba1dcdd7d45b48c0c3d07711686e6.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><h3 id="200610"><a class="link"   href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/200610/3022" >Parental Control Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><span class="text-ad-content">    #1 Rated Parental Control Software.<br/>    Monitor & Control all PC Activity!<br/>        <cite style="color:green">sentrypc.com/parental-controls/</cite>    </span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/200610/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## **Graphics: Outdated, but detailed on optimal**<p> For a game that was released in 2013 originally, the graphics could be a little better, even if you play on optimal settings. Back in the day, we played on lower settings rather than splurge on a fancy graphics card. If you play on the lower settings, it’s cringeworthy, though not as cringeworthy as the Witcher 3’s lowest settings.</p><p> 7 Days has a decent 3D graphics system that they’ve definitely improved as the alpha updates have been released. As a consequence, the minimum requirements have also increased. Those who play on minimum settings may want to take note of that. While we hope they’ll improve these over the next alpha updates, we are taking the graphics as they are at the time of this review, and right now, while they’re detailed on optimal settings, they could be better.</p><p> Because the graphics are a rather mixed bag, the frames per second (fps) can vary dramatically. We experienced drops as low as 18 fps when playing. When surrounded by a horde, that can cost you your life.</p><h2 id="Platform-It’s-complicated"><a href="#Platform-It’s-complicated" class="headerlink" title="Platform: It’s complicated"></a><strong>Platform: It’s complicated</strong></h2><p> 7 Days to Die runs on many platforms:<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mac-4155662" >PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ps4-ps4-slim-and-ps4-pro-4154452" >PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-360-buyers-guide-3562451" >Xbox 360 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . We played 7 Days on PC, and at the time of writing, they released a teaser for the Alpha 18 update which would roll out to the PC version of the game.</p><p> Last time we checked, the company that owned all console rights, Telltale, went bust, and The Fun Pimps (the developer) were in legal limbo trying to reacquire their own rights. There’s a good chance that there will not be an update in the console versions of the game anytime soon as this issue makes its way through the courts. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you purchase the PC version if you decide this is a game you might like to try.</p><h2 id="Price-Average-for-an-alpha-game"><a href="#Price-Average-for-an-alpha-game" class="headerlink" title="Price: Average for an alpha game"></a><strong>Price: Average for an alpha game</strong></h2><p> At around $25, 7 Days isn’t the most expensive zombie game on the market. However, it is the most expensive alpha zombie game out there. Because you can purchase it on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-steam-4177380" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Humble Bumble, we recommend waiting for a Steam sale and getting it for a discount, especially since it’s still in progress. This way, if you decide you don’t like it in the future, you aren’t out the full price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242"                      border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Other-sandbox-shooters"><a href="#Competition-Other-sandbox-shooters" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other sandbox shooters"></a><strong>Competition: Other sandbox shooters</strong></h2><p> It’s hard to compare 7 Days to other sandboxes out there because of the significant focus on crafting and building.<a class="link"   href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/" >Minecraft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has expansive crafting and arguably good graphics with its classic blocky appearance. Terraria also boasts zombies and crafting and building capabilities, though they’re 2D instead of 3D like in 7 Days. And all of them can guarantee hours of gameplay with fun twists and turns.</p><p> If anything can set these games apart, it’s the sheer realism of 7 Days. You need water and you need to hunt, forage, and scavenge to survive. You will feel the effects of heat as the desert raises your temperature, and you will starve as the snow biome depletes your caloric intake. And that’s all before we’ve mentioned the wolves and zombie bears (yes, they exist, and no, they are not easy to take down) in 7 Days. If you like a sense of realism in your zombie games, then 7 Days is for you. If not, we suggest taking a look at Minecraft or<a class="link"   href="https://terraria.org/" >Terraria <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>If you love smart zombies, you’ll love this game.</strong></p><p> Despite flaws in graphics, there’s a lot to love about 7 Days to Die. The challenging skill tree system and dangerous intelligent zombies add an element that’s not typically found in zombie shooters. If you want a game to commit to for hours on end, building bases and exploring dungeon-like homes while slaying zombie cheerleaders, then 7 Days to Die could be a fun way to ease some stress after a long day of work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img                       lazyload

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re seeking a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-fitness-trackers-4057119" >fitness tracking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> wearable that doesn’t keep you glued to a screen or checking in constantly for notifications and updates, the Amazon Halo band could be the minimalist device for you. This screen-less band is slim and visually unobtrusive, but behind the scenes, it quietly evaluates your tone of voice, moments of activity, and sedentary stints, and also offers up sophisticated sleep data meant to empower you to a better night’s sleep. And unlike the biggest names in the wearable fitness game such as Fitbit and Apple, the Halo band also offers 3D body fat imaging for another insight into wellness tracking.</p><p> As a dedicated fitness tracker user, I was thrown off by the lack of any sort of interface on the Halo, but my full seven-day experience did serve to help me become more aware of my quality of sleep and general activity levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/W0-czfRzA-7ixa5VS8Cb4sBcaqM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon_Halo_02-b2292f1ee1b54f4e9990c92e582c5a4b.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Halo"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-An-accessory-that-blends-in"><a href="#Design-An-accessory-that-blends-in" class="headerlink" title="Design: An accessory that blends in"></a>Design: An accessory that blends in</h2><p> The Halo band doesn’t overwhelm the senses. I tested a small-sized band in silver and appreciated the streamlined bracelet style form factor. The fabric strap, which is a mix of sweat-wicking synthetics, has an athleisure look and feel: sporty but not to the degree that it screams sport watch. Rounding out the minimalist look is one sole button on the side of the sensor unit, which is flanked by an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> indicator and one of two internal microphones. The other mic is located on the back, along with the optical sensor; it’s largely undetectable if you manage a close fit.</p><p> Slightly less sophisticated, however, is the charging clip. It’s a boxy bar with a hinge that opens to place the device inside. Because it’s so lightweight—venturing on flimsy—I experienced the clip part slipping and snapping closed before I could place the wearable in the charging cradle. This slightly inelegant charging accessory seems a bit at odds with the more polished tracker design.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729320&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/2_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QHImxX0EsYwunnnS2aNtTX9j80s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon_Halo_03-66da73beea854cd39f6c35c06975ef4e.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Halo"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Comfort-Streamlined-but-not-immune-to-typical-fit-issues"><a href="#Comfort-Streamlined-but-not-immune-to-typical-fit-issues" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Streamlined but not immune to typical fit issues"></a>Comfort: Streamlined but not immune to typical fit issues</h2><p> While the easy-adjusting Velcro strap is a welcome departure from the typical notch-and-clasp closure on most fitness trackers, adjusting the fit or removing the device wasn’t as smooth as I’d expected it to be. The end of the strap is finished with hardware that prevents the strap from coming completely undone from the loop. The band also includes a series of five strong Velcro strips&#x2F;notches that serve as sizing adjusters. This construction helps prevent accidental drops when taking the band on&#x2F;off, which is never a bad thing. On the other hand, though, the Velcro strips are so sturdy that they restricted quick adjustments and made removing the band less swift overall.</p><p> Even with the sizing flexibility Velcro offers, the Halo isn’t immune to the fit troubles any silicone band presents. While the fabric is soft and comfortable against the skin, I still found it difficult to find the best fit for my small wrist. If I started the day with a tighter adjustment (which was very easy to do with this band), by the end of the day, I had to loosen it to account for temperature and swelling fluctuations.</p><p> While the easy-adjusting Velcro strap is a welcome departure from the typical notch-and-clasp closure on most fitness trackers, adjusting the fit or removing the device wasn’t as smooth as I’d expected it to be.</p><p> As for water resistance, I didn’t test the 50-meter swimproof rating of the Halo in a pool, but I did shower with the device for three days. Despite the band’s moisture-wicking band material, it remained damp far longer than was comfortable and compared to a fast-drying silicone band. If you’re an avid swimmer or prefer not to remove your wearable while showering, the sport band option will most likely be the more desirable option.</p><h2 id="Performance-Constantly-monitoring-movement-not-performance"><a href="#Performance-Constantly-monitoring-movement-not-performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Constantly monitoring movement, not performance"></a>Performance: Constantly monitoring movement, not performance</h2><p> While this streamlined device doesn’t log detailed workout metrics, the Halo has the upper hand when it comes to continuously monitoring movement—and sedentary stints throughout the day. Whether you’re sitting at a desk or venture out for an errand, the Halo will capture that and pretty accurately categorize it. It consistently registered walking and running activities, though the readout wasn’t very accurate for the latter. Truthfully, I don’t get the impression that that’s the point of the Halo.</p><p> Instead, the Halo presents all activity data through a convenient point-tracking system. The weekly goal is 150, which converts to 150 minutes of cardiovascular activity, as recommended by the American Heart Association. Periods of movement and exercise count toward this point goal, while periods of non-movement subtract from points earned. It’s a digestible system that offers a new twist on the steps or movement alert functions you’ll find in fitness trackers and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, and others. This system was an encouraging reset from those reminders that sometimes feel more annoying than motivating.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FjdFyV6Y4mTXNsqccZ4aEBJNpV0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon_Halo_05-e671ee9f77cc4cee8e2580a2dba449d5.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Halo"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener.</p><p> The Halo also offers around-the-clock heart rate monitoring and quite detailed sleep tracking analysis and explanations of data tracked. The sleep metrics surpass the high-level data I’ve experienced from devices such as the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-sense-review-5085832" >Fitbit Sense <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-fit2-review-5094526" >Samsung Fit2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and helped me feel more attuned to how I was sleeping each night based on my sleep score, disturbances logged, and how long it took me to fall asleep.</p><p> But the most buzzed-about<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/smart-watches-and-wearables-4781531" >wearable technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Halo offers is voice tone and body fat analysis. While I don’t have constant meetings throughout the day that would have helped with this data, it was interesting to review the Halo band’s observations about tone changes during personal and professional conversations. These “notable moments” are expressed with an emoji that signifies one of four tones ranging from displeased to amused. You can’t drill down further to see which moment the Halo captured, but this tool seems to promote more self-awareness of how you might sound to others more than anything else.</p><p> All voice data and images used for the body scan are deletable from the app, though you can also choose to back up body data in the cloud, which Amazon assures is private and well secured.</p><p> The body fat scan is based on pictures uploaded to the app—and based on prompts from the app. While it felt invasive and isn’t a feature I’d seek out in a fitness tracker, it worked without issue. Amazon reports that this technology is twice as accurate as smart scales. For the right user who feels comfortable with this kind of data compilation, this feature also offers visualizations of how different body fat percentages would look on your frame and stores your scans for a look at trends over time.

Sleep data is backed up by explanations as is the activity point tracking system. Automatically tracked workout data is also easily accessible and so is the option to manually upload workout activities (there are 38 to choose from, including an all-encompassing Other category).</p><p> Without a visual display to interact with, the accompanying Halo mobile app is absolutely essential to the user experience.</p><p> Like Fitbit, the Halo also comes with a free 6-month trial to a Halo membership, which includes various guided wellness programs from the Discover tab of the app. I followed along with various circuit, HIIT, and equipment-free workouts all of which offered some sort of video to follow along with as well as audio instructions. The Halo band would certainly lack the same sort of appeal without access to these programs that are great if you want to sneak in a quick workout, or you’re an avid at-home exerciser who likes to mix things up.</p><p> The app makes everything from the initial setup to body scanning and voice tracking straightforward.</p><h2 id="Battery-Enough-juice-to-last-nearly-a-week"><a href="#Battery-Enough-juice-to-last-nearly-a-week" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Enough juice to last nearly a week"></a>Battery: Enough juice to last nearly a week</h2><p> Amazon says that with tone tracking enabled, the band should last up to seven days on a single charge. There are two options for tracking tone: one for more accuracy and one to optimize battery life. I chose the latter and found that the band lasted for six days, which comes close to the manufacturer’s claims. I also noticed that by manually muting the mic, the battery drained far less quickly than when I left it on to listen at all times.</p><p> While this isn’t the longest-lasting battery, it was rapid to charge at just about 1 hour and 15 minutes. It was also easy to keep track of battery life and avoid inadvertently over-charging the device, thanks to system notifications that popped up on my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-makes-a-smartphone-smart-579597" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when my band battery was low as well as when it was fully charged and ready to go again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4699091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/1_jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh Plus -  Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

While the lack of display could be a deterrent, the solid mobile app provides convenient access to the detailed sleep, automatic activity tracking, and specialized tone of voice and body fat analysis the Halo provides.</p><h2 id="Amazon-Halo-vs-WHOOP-Strap-3"><a href="#Amazon-Halo-vs-WHOOP-Strap-3" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Halo vs. WHOOP Strap 3"></a>Amazon Halo vs. WHOOP Strap 3</h2><p> The WHOOP Strap 3 is another screen-less fitness tracker with a minimalist bent but a bigger buy-in and emphasis on performance. Unlike the Halo, the WHOOP Strap requires a WHOOP membership, which, at the lowest end, costs $30 monthly for a 6-month membership or $180 total (band included). The Halo band comes with a free six-month subscription to Halo app services, then a $3.99 monthly charge, so it’s considerably cheaper—especially since WHOOP recommends replacing their fabric strap every six months as well.</p><p> The WHOOP Strap does come with many more strap color and accessory options than the Halo, including custom engraving. Battery life is slightly behind at about five days, but you can access data on a desktop, and there’s a social aspect to the WHOOP platform that the Halo lacks. While both options forego a busy screen for streamlined wrist-based trackers and feature-rich companion apps, the best choice for you will likely come down to whether the athletic performance tracking of the WHOOP appeals over the wellness-tuned Halo.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A futuristic wearable for wellness enthusiasts.</strong></p><p> The Amazon Halo isn’t for everyone with its lack of display and additional layers of data tracking to capture tone of voice and body fat percentage. But for the user that wants a little less hardware but more forward-thinking fitness&#x2F;health tracking, this unique wearable offers a different approach to increasing activity and wellness awareness on a daily basis.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851691&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-series-6-review-5087552" >Apple Watch Series 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-sense-review-5085832" >Fitbit Sense <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ticwatch-pro-4g-review-4797547" >Ticwatch Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Halo</li><li>Product Brand  Amazon</li><li>SKU  6445215</li><li>Price  $100.00</li><li>Release Date  December 2020</li><li>Weight  0.63 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.64 x 8.4 x 4.1 in.</li><li>Color  Winter&#x2F;Silver, Blush&#x2F;Rose Gold, Black&#x2F;Onyx</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Compatibility  iOS, Android</li><li>Battery Capacity  Up to 7 days</li><li>Water Resistance  Up to 50 meters</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-voice-logging-system-audit/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Voice Logging System Audit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-advanced-guide-to-mastering-the-art-of-morphvox-audio-transformation/"><u>[Updated] Advanced Guide to Mastering the Art of MorphVOX Audio Transformation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-maximizing-impact-with-every-second-in-a-youtube-short/"><u>[Updated] Maximizing Impact with Every Second in a YouTube Short</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-preserving-your-online-reputation-amidst-faux-endorsements/"><u>2024 Approved  Preserving Your Online Reputation Amidst Faux Endorsements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-superior-fb-extra-tools-video-grabs-firefox-version/"><u>2024 Approved  Superior FB Extra Tools  Video Grabs, Firefox Version</u></a></li><li><a href="https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/2024s-guide-to-perfectly-pairing-hp-printer-with-laptops/"><u>2024'S Guide to Perfectly Pairing HP Printer with Laptops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-6-ways-to-transfer-contacts-from-motorola-moto-g84-5g-to-iphone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 6 Ways To Transfer Contacts From Motorola Moto G84 5G to iPhone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-pokemon-emerald-master-ball-cheat-on-oneplus-12r-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Use Pokémon Emerald Master Ball Cheat On OnePlus 12R | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-speed-instant-signature-background-cleanup/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking Speed  Instant Signature Background Cleanup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/lenovo-tab-m10-hd-2e-the-perfect-blend-of-affordability-and-performance-for-web-browsing-and-media-enjoyment-a-2020-in-depth-analysis/"><u>Lenovo Tab M10 HD (2E): The Perfect Blend of Affordability and Performance for Web Browsing & Media Enjoyment -

The Switch is one of Nintendo’s best-selling devices ever, despite hardware that lags behind the competition in terms of power. The Switch Lite builds on that success with similar hardware, complete compatibility, and an even more portable form factor.</p><p> Where the original Switch is a hybrid portable console, the Switch Lite is a more traditional handheld gaming device. It still provides most of the best features of the full-sized Switch, but it’s also Nintendo’s only pure portable since the discontinuation of the 3DS family of handhelds.</p><p> Although I appreciate what Nintendo has done here with the Lite, a few key missing features might not make it the optimal choice for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/EUqklfDyxuB1ye8-DBboDrjzkUw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-2-225f5107c7b74f159afecba8c3f6174a.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Design-Cute-and-compact"><a href="#Design-Cute-and-compact" class="headerlink" title="Design: Cute and compact"></a><strong>Design: Cute and compact</strong></h2><p> It’s hard not to swoon at the sight of the Switch Lite. The handheld console is cute and compact, featuring unique color options, bright white buttons, and joysticks wrapped around a downsized screen. The whole unit is about the size of a beefy phablet. The screen alone is about the size of an iPhone SE.</p><p> Compared to its larger cousin, this device is light and slim, with a smooth matte surface that spills across the entire unit in a beautiful, uninterrupted fashion. Whereas the regular Switch creates a stark contrast between each Joy-Con and the console, the Lite is one continuous body that creates a sleeker look and sturdier feel.</p><p> Looking at both Switches side-by-side, the Lite isn’t massively smaller in comparison, but it seems that way when you swap between the two. The reduction in size and weight doesn’t make it challenging to use for those with larger hands.</p><p> The screen has been decreased from 6.2 inches to 5.5 inches, still sporting the same plastic overlay above it (meaning you’ll want to get a glass protector to prevent scratches), and the length and height have been trimmed down a good bit. The most obvious change here is the overall length of the Lite, which is slimmer by roughly the size of an entire Joy-Con on one side.</p><p> The smaller size is because the regular Switch has removable controllers, and the Lite does not. The compromise on its size is that you can’t take your Joy-Cons off and instantly start playing a local multiplayer game. Although that might be disappointing for some, the Lite now feels much better for long handheld gaming sessions when compared to the bulkier model.</p><p> Although I appreciate what Nintendo has done here with the Lite, a few key missing features might not make it the optimal choice for everyone.</p><p> Aside from the lack of removable controllers, the Lite features the same layout as the Joy-Con inputs, down to the spacing and functions. On the left are two shoulder buttons, a minus button (select), a joystick, a directional pad, and a screenshot button. The right side is mostly the same, with two more shoulders, a plus button (start), four inputs, another joystick, and a home button.</p><p> The only real notable difference here is that Nintendo has opted for a traditional D-pad, which is leagues better than the old layout for platformers, fighting games, and pretty much everything else. This distinction is, of course, because you’ll no longer be removing the left controller and requiring it to function as a separate device.</p><p> The top is home to the power button and volume toggle, a vent, a 3.5mm jack, and the game card slot, while the bottom holds the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> input for power and the addition of a new standalone SD card slot.</p><p> Where there’s usually a kickstand on the Switch with a hidden SD card slot, this version drops that option (since you can no longer remove the Joy-Con for tabletop mode) and adds a small door for expanding your storage. The kickstand was flimsy anyway, so you likely won’t miss it.</p><p> There’s still the issue with the USB-C port sticking straight out of the bottom, making it hard to sit flat against something, but this is somewhat less annoying since you’ll likely be holding it while gaming. Unfortunately, the Lite does not fit into the dock that came with a Switch. If you want to charge it, you have to plug it directly into the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-c-chargers-4155815" >USB-C charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the one on a regular Switch, as they’re the same.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7502vZ1Vh2D4nRux6hEnq4BL3Rk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-5-2fb7aa309cc54dd79c07bd799ef7fe84.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-spreadsheet-free-excel-editor-online-offline-1x.93e269d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Hit-the-switch"><a href="#Setup-Process-Hit-the-switch" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Hit the switch"></a><strong>Setup Process: Hit the switch</strong></h2><p> If you’ve set up a previous Switch console in the past, the process here is mostly the same, but it’s even easier since there are no Joy-Cons.</p><p> Since the Lite is exclusively handheld, there’s no dock to worry about here, but make sure your console has enough juice before beginning setup. Setup starts with pushing the power button on the top and is facilitated by an on-screen guide that helps you set up the usual stuff like Wi-Fi, account creation (or login), etc. When complete, either pop in a game card or download one digitally to begin gaming.</p><p> Things get trickier if you have an existing Nintendo account that you want to use with both the Switch Lite and an older Switch. The good news is that you can, but the bad news is that Nintendo doesn’t make it super convenient.</p><p> When you link your Nintendo account during setup, you can choose which Switch you want to be your primary system and which will be your secondary. That means that Nintendo essentially makes you decide to set up the Switch Lite as a secondary system that can only play your games while logged in and connected to Wi-Fi, or you can transfer the old Switch’s data to the new one.</p><p> Things get trickier if you have an existing Nintendo account that you want to use with both the Switch Lite and an older Switch. The good news is that you can, but the bad news is that Nintendo doesn’t make it super convenient.</p><p> If you opt to make your Lite the secondary, you can kiss goodbye to playing any of your digital games on the go unless you have stable Wi-Fi on hand. Because of this, I decided to make my docked Switch the secondary (since it is always at home with Wi-Fi access).</p><p> While this does solve most of the issues, it’s annoying that it forces you to choose. Other systems, like Xbox, only allow one “home” console to play your games without being logged in, but it’s less of an issue since those consoles aren’t portable.</p><p> Another thorn in the side here is that your saved data is local, and if you want to save data to the cloud, you will have to pay for Nintendo’s online service (thankfully, it’s cheap). However, none of this data migration will happen automatically like other gaming consoles. You’ll need to manually download your saves locally each time and then update them on the console you want to use, even with the cloud option.</p><p> Sure, all of this does work, but it’s a pain to do and feels like another shortsighted attempt from Nintendo in a world where other competitors are leagues ahead. With other consoles and PC platforms like Steam, your saved data syncs to the cloud automatically, allowing you to play wherever you want without worrying about losing progress.</p><p> There’s yet another issue if you have kids or multiple accounts on your Switches. Since one Switch is now set as your primary, other users can’t access all your games from a secondary console.</p><p> For example, if you set the Switch Lite as your primary system, nobody can play games you’ve bought and downloaded on your home Switch unless they log into your account. You could always keep that other Switch as your primary, but then your Switch Lite will need Wi-Fi to access titles. It’s easy to see the problem there, but apparently, Nintendo doesn’t.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453720/17020" target="_top" id="1453720"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453720"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453720/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kQx9K3tATPBWAMgyJJymqBqYPao=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-3-7349fa7d79f34dbaa50c25cb59aec820.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Decent-for-mobile-gaming-but-no-FHD"><a href="#Performance-Decent-for-mobile-gaming-but-no-FHD" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent for mobile gaming, but no FHD"></a><strong>Performance: Decent for mobile gaming, but no FHD</strong></h2><p> Much like the original Switch, the Lite is by no means a powerhouse console sporting top-of-the-line graphics and hardware. That said, it doesn’t necessarily need to be. The Switch Lite performs similarly to its larger counterpart while in handheld mode, but let’s delve into specifics.</p><p> Sporting the same custom Tegra X1 from Nvidia, the Switch Lite has plenty of CPU and GPU power for its humble needs. The screen maxes out at a 720p resolution, which isn’t great but gets the job done on such a small screen. Since you can’t use the Switch Lite with a dock, there’s no way to play in 1080p.</p><p> Although the screen is reduced from 6.2 inches to 5.5 inches on the Lite, I didn’t notice a big difference. The Lite’s display packs more pixels per inch (PPI) at 267 PPI compared to the original Switch’s 236 PPI. The display looks sharper, but with such a marginal difference, most won’t notice much.</p><p> I’ve played many games on the Switch Lite, including modern classics like<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review-4685759" >The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Pokémon Let’s Go, and Shovel Knight. All these had a solid performance from the console, with no considerable dips in frames, hiccups, or freezes.</p><p> Like its predecessor’s mobile mode, the Switch Lite is unfortunately capped at 30 FPS for many titles (though it can hit 60 in some single-player games). Unlike the Switch, which you can dock to boost performance, you’re stuck with the handheld specs on the Lite.</p><p> A quick example is that single-player Mario Kart 8 Deluxe runs at a smooth 60 FPS in 1080p on a docked Switch but 720p at 60 FPS in the handheld mode. Adding more players reduces your frames to 30 FPS, which is also true for Smash Bros. The Switch Lite isn’t designed for single-device multiplayer, though, and you’re unlikely to get three or more players all crouched behind the 5.5-inch screen anyway.</p><p> These somewhat disappointing performance numbers look bad compared to a home console but remember that this is a handheld console that you can play for hours on end without needing a power cable.</p><p> If you’re like me and love to use the previous Switch in handheld mode for single-player games, the Lite will quickly become your go-to Switch for this particular setting. I’d even argue that this is perhaps the ideal way you should use it.</p><p> Another thorn in the side here is that your saved data is local, and if you want to save data to the cloud, you will have to pay for Nintendo’s online service (thankfully, it’s cheap).</p><p> Since the Switch Lite doesn’t have detachable Joy-Cons, you’ll need to bring an extra controller if you want to play local multiplayer games on the go. It works the same way as the original console, but it’s far less practical on the Lite since you can’t dock it, it doesn’t have a kickstand, you need separate controllers, and the screen is smaller. The option is there if you want, but this isn’t the Switch for you if you want to do local multiplayer.</p><p> Online multiplayer does, however, work pretty well. Boot up a game like Super Mario Party, Super Smash Bros., or your favorite free-to-play shooter and connect to the internet just like you would on the original Switch. For most matchmaking, however, you’ll need to pick up Nintendo’s online subscription service<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nintendo-switch-online-4175784" >Nintendo Switch Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> This service is inexpensive at just $20 a year (or $35 a year for a family plan that allows up to eight users, also available at $4 a month), but many remain frustrated with its capabilities. It includes cool perks, like access to a growing library of NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and Sega Genesis games, the Nintendo Switch Online smartphone app, Save Data Cloud, and special offers for members.</p><p> Once again, there’s no Ethernet port, so you can stick with Wi-Fi and hope for the best or grab an aftermarket adapter, which is far less practical on the Lite, seeing how it’s handheld only.</p><p> Online games have worked well for me, despite needing to rely on Wi-Fi. However, Nintendo’s online service is still far behind the likes of Sony or Microsoft, and the lack of a wired connection means you may run into issues with speed and stability if your Wi-Fi isn’t great.</p><p> Frustrations like the lack of in-game chat cripple the Nintendo Switch Online, and Nintendo has done little to address these issues. Many functions still require you to use the app on your smartphone (like online voice chat), and while Xbox and PlayStation users get free games for their consoles as part of their subscription services, Switch users only get older virtual console games.</p><p> All said and done, the performance is excellent for single-player experiences on the Switch Lite, with online multiplayer trailing behind but perfectly functional. Local multiplayer is easily one of the biggest strengths of the original Switch and our favorite aspect. However, the methods used to create a more portable console with the Lite also severely hurt its viability.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KxMaFgooi4rm3qbImmLKatuUtVI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-4-ef84dbbbde3d48ff97515e5c6b9981a4.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Software-Still-a-bit-drab-but-smooth-and-snappy"><a href="#Software-Still-a-bit-drab-but-smooth-and-snappy" class="headerlink" title="Software: Still a bit drab, but smooth and snappy"></a><strong>Software: Still a bit drab, but smooth and snappy</strong></h2><p> If you’ve got an older Switch already or at least spent some time with one, the software found on the Switch Lite is exactly the same. Thankfully, that means it’s clean and snappy, but also a bit boring.</p><p> Booting up your Switch takes you to a quick start screen that allows you to either jump back into your recently used game or go straight to the main home screen by pressing the home button. This home screen provides a horizontal scrolling line of tiles for your games and apps, arranged by what you’ve recently used. Moving down to the lower row provides access to stuff like news, the eShop, screenshots, controller settings or the console’s settings.</p><p> Although you likely won’t be using Joy-Cons too often with the Lite, the bottom right will display your current controller setup so you know what’s connected. There’s also a handy little guide for what buttons you can use to interact with the options on screen. Up top, your profile and friends list can be accessed alongside a clock, a Wi-Fi meter, and a battery gauge.</p><p> Despite being stripped of some of the Switch’s more unique features and strengths, the Switch Lite is a perfect console for gamers on the go or those who prefer handheld.</p><p> While the overall UI is quick and navigable, it feels drab. There are still no themes to swap aside from a simple light or dark mode, so don’t get too lofty with your customization ideas.</p><p> The biggest strength of the UI might be that you can use the touchscreen for most functions outside of games. Navigating the screen by tapping elements is even easier than using the controllers, and having an on-screen keyboard means typing out names and info is as easy as texting on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eFyBn6jL7cdHOO4q7zc6pALdQzw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-6-42a5bc5ea4e544bdb6d3fbbd074583c2.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Battery-Life-Slightly-better-but-not-the-best"><a href="#Battery-Life-Slightly-better-but-not-the-best" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: Slightly better, but not the best"></a><strong>Battery Life: Slightly better, but not the best</strong></h2><p> Battery life on the original Switch was just okay, to put it lightly, but typically you were lucky to get anything over 3 hours of screen time with most titles. It eventually received a bigger battery in a minor hardware revision, which helped. The Switch Lite has a slightly smaller battery than the revised Switch but also has lower power needs due to its small screen.</p><p> The Lite comes equipped with a 3,570mAh lithium-ion battery (compared to the 4,310mAh on the first Switch) that promises 3 to 7 hours of runtime. That extensive range exists because some activities on the console are far less demanding than others.</p><p> This slight bump in battery life is primarily due to the Switch Lite’s smaller screen, which needs less juice. Charging the battery takes about three hours, but only if you drain it completely. Using it occasionally instead of for extended gaming sessions, I’ve found that I don’t need to charge it that often and that it charges fast when I do.</p><p> Demanding titles like Breath of the Wild will still place you on the shorter end of that battery life spectrum, but I could log about 3.5-4 hours even with Zelda. Indie games and others that are less power-hungry can get you up to 5 hours and above. Note that you can tweak settings like brightness, Wi-Fi, and airplane mode to give even more screen time.</p><p> A portable charger is still one of the best accessories you can pick up for the Switch, and there are many quality options out that are approved by Nintendo. I recommend picking one up, but be careful which one you choose. I’ve stuck with reputable brands and haven’t had any trouble, but I have heard horror stories from people who have bricked their consoles with unsupported options.</p><p> Lastly, the battery is internal, so you can’t easily pop in a new one when it starts to degrade. While I haven’t seen any degradation with mine, it’ll happen at some point. When it does, sending it to Nintendo for repair is the only real option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Inexpensive-console-gaming-in-your-hands"><a href="#Price-Inexpensive-console-gaming-in-your-hands" class="headerlink" title="Price: Inexpensive console gaming in your hands"></a><strong>Price: Inexpensive console gaming in your hands</strong></h2><p> It’s no surprise that since Nintendo removed many features from the Switch to create the Lite model, the price has also decreased considerably. The Switch is already at a pretty sweet price of $300, so how does the Lite stack up?</p><p> The Switch Lite has an MSRP of $200, which is a pretty good value. It plays all the same games as the original Switch at a significantly lower price and is much more portable. You do lose the ability to dock it; for some people, that feature will be worth the extra $100.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7XA6hgAK2B4hDSlWdmB8VQddrjw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-7-Comparison-44dcf88ec51247a2b0756445a3c7884d.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36245101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/zang_box_trust.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Extreme Security NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Nintendo-Switch-Lite-vs-Nintendo-Switch"><a href="#Nintendo-Switch-Lite-vs-Nintendo-Switch" class="headerlink" title="Nintendo Switch Lite vs. Nintendo Switch"></a><strong>Nintendo Switch Lite vs. Nintendo Switch</strong></h2><p> The biggest competitor to the Switch Lite is the original Switch. Nintendo has done an excellent job with both of these devices, but they each have some strengths and weaknesses you should consider before buying.</p><p> The first thing to consider is whether you want to play couch co-op or versus with your friends. If you plan to use your Switch primarily for playing Mario Party or Smash Bros. with a bunch of your friends on the couch—get the regular Switch. You need the original Switch to play on a larger screen, and it also comes with two Joy-Cons that you can use as separate controllers.</p><p> Even if you wanted to play with one other person locally on your Switch Lite, you’d need to spend about $60-70 on some Joy-Cons or a Pro Controller, thus nearly reaching the price of the full-sized console.</p><p> If you plan to use your Switch primarily for stuff like playing Mario Party or Smash Bros. with a bunch of your friends on the couch—get the regular Switch.</p><p> If you feel like you’ll use your Switch away from home, or you’re primarily a solo player who plans to focus on single-player games or online multiplayer, the Switch Lite is equally good here. The main difference is that the Lite can only be used in handheld mode and takes a slight hit in resolution. The strengths of the Switch Lite are that it’s ultra-compact and portable, so if you mainly want something to take with you from place to place, it’s the better bet.</p><p> The Switch Lite also makes a great companion device if you already have a Switch. If you have both, you get the best of both worlds—the Lite’s portability and the regular Switch’s extra features.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Perfect for gamers who prefer handheld.</strong></p><p> Despite being stripped of some of the Switch’s more unique features and strengths, the Switch Lite is a perfect console for gamers on the go or those who prefer handheld. It features an extensive library of exclusives that are perfect for a highly mobile system like Animal Crossing—and it’s hard to argue with the price.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-review-4707563" >Nintendo Switch Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-review-one-power-packed-4k-console-5088039" >Xbox Series X Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-series-s-review-5085770" >Xbox Series S Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >Sony PlayStation 5 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242"                      border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Switch Lite</li><li>Product Brand  Nintendo</li><li>UPC  070004640519</li><li>Price  $199.99</li><li>Weight  9.7 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.6 x 8.2 x 0.55 in.</li><li>Warranty  1-year warranty</li><li>CPU  Nvidia Custom Tegra X1</li><li>GPU  Nvidia Custom Tegra X1</li><li>RAM  4GB</li><li>Storage  32GB internal, one micro SD slot (up to 2TB)</li><li>Ports  USB-C, 3.5mm audio jack</li><li>Screen  Multi-touch capacitive touchscreen &#x2F; 5.5-inch LCD Screen &#x2F; 1280 x 720</li><li>Battery  Lithium-ion battery&#x2F;3570mAh</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-mastering-iphone-macro-photography-detailed-images-at-your-fingertips/"><u>[New] Mastering iPhone Macro Photography  Detailed Images at Your Fingertips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-techniques-for-precise-iptv-screen-imaging-for-2024/"><u>[New] Ultimate Techniques for Precise IPTV Screen Imaging for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-10-hilarious-tiktok-skits-unveiled/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top 10 Hilarious TikTok Skits Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-clearer-iphone-hd-images-post-production-with-4-key-premiere-pro-fixes/"><u>2024 Approved  Clearer iPhone HD Images Post-Production with 4 Key Premiere Pro Fixes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-detailed-guide-to-capturing-minecraft-gameplay-events/"><u>2024 Approved  Detailed Guide to Capturing Minecraft Gameplay Events</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-revealing-gone-reddit-content-a-time-savers-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Revealing Gone-Reddit Content  A Time Saver's Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-complete-guide-to-facebook-dominance-business-edition/"><u>2024 Approved  The Complete Guide to Facebook Dominance  Business Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/action-cameras-clash-gopro-hero5-black-against-yi-4k-update-for-2024/"><u>Action Cameras Clash  GoPro Hero5 Black Against Yi 4K Update for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/affordable-protection-with-procase-macbook-pro-13/"><u>Affordable Protection with ProCase -

Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender takes on a different kind of philosophy. That’s reflected in the boosted price, certainly, but also the capabilities: this is the first Wi-Fi 6 extender on the market.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a new standard that not only allows for faster maximum speeds than previous generations but also better accommodates the increasing pile of wireless devices that we have around our homes and connecting at any given time—from phones to laptops and smart home gadgets. Newer smartphones and laptops are implementing support for the standard, and new Wi-Fi routers are being released to supply those benefits.</p><p> If you don’t already have one of those new Wi-Fi 6 routers, should you spend extra for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 to futureproof your setup? Here’s what I think after testing the device for several days across everyday web usage, media streaming, playing online games, and more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Pretty-awkward"><a href="#Design-Pretty-awkward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Pretty awkward"></a><strong>Design: Pretty awkward</strong></h2><p> The Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is not only the largest and heaviest Wi-Fi extender I’ve tested at 10 inches tall and nearly two pounds, but it’s also one of the oddest-looking. It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward. Also, the little plastic feet don’t do a great job of supporting the weight, making it a bit wobbly on a flat surface.</p><p> With very large sides, the front is really just a small panel with light-up LED indicators showing connectivity details and which Ethernet ports are in use. There’s also a small WPS button beneath the LED panel for easy connectivity with a router. On the wider back panel are the four wired<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for plugging in devices such as game consoles and computers, as well as a USB 3.0 port, DC power port, and the power button itself.</p><p> It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app"><a href="#Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Avoid the app"></a><strong>Setup Process: Avoid the app</strong></h2><p> The setup options for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 are the same as with Netgear’s other extenders—even those without Wi-Fi 6 support. You’ll begin with the extender plugged in near your router. If your router supports<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wps-4842308" >WPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , then you can pair the extender with it easily by following the process listed in the included booklet, which is as simple as pressing a button on the router and then doing the same on the extender.</p><p> If that’s not an option, or you’d rather follow a step-by-step process with prompts, then you can set it up using either a mobile (iOS or Android) app or a web browser on your computer.</p><p> The mobile app has been unreliable in my experience with other Netgear extenders, but it was much worse when setting up the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The app repeatedly could not connect with the created mesh network on the extender during setup, and I had to factory reset the device multiple times to start again.</p><p> Over and over, the setup process wouldn’t complete… and then it finally did. I ran into similar issues with the other Netgear extenders, in which setup processes didn’t work as expected on the first or second time, but this was a much longer and more arduous ordeal. Finally, however, I got the Nighthawk AX8 up and running. From there, you’ll need to find a new location for the extender—roughly halfway between the router and your Wi-Fi dead zone is ideal, but play around with positioning if you’re not getting the results you seek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xru8JLL_UOk3sXBYpbrOyAl-ihc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_02-b120eab8816746338c53e4eb1cfc62d6.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Smooth-sailing"><a href="#Connectivity-Smooth-sailing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Smooth sailing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Smooth sailing</strong></h2><p> Once through the hassle of setup, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender really did deliver strong performance. I tested the connection in my office, which reliably sees reduced 5GHz reception from my router due to obstructions in between, and saw a noticeable boost in both reception and speed.</p><p> In one test, I registered a 5GHz speed of 246Mbps with the extender, which was the fastest wireless speed I’ve seen anywhere in my house using that older, TP-Link router. Given that, I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The router isn’t Wi-Fi 6 compatible, but I still saw higher top-end speeds than ever before.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender also performed pretty well in distance testing. In another instance, I registered a 5GHz download speed of 87Mbps with my office, and then measured the speeds from my backyard at approximate distance intervals from the extender.</p><p> I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8.</p><p> That 5GHz signal dropped down to 77Mbps at 25 feet, 74Mbps at 50 feet, and 56Mbps at 25 feet—still pretty speedy from the farthest edge of my property. Meanwhile, the 2.4GHz signal started at just 42Mbps at that moment in my office, and dropped to 30Mbps at 25 feet, 28Mbps at 50 feet, and 26Mbps at 75 feet.</p><p> Given the high max speeds, it wasn’t surprising to see strong gaming performance, as well. While playing Rocket League, I saw smooth gameplay across the wired Ethernet connection as well as both wireless networks, with a ping as low as 33 via the wired connection. The wireless ping was only a few points higher.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39655089&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/wa/01_WA_728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rtnI3hSe9qP5qFqjhu1LRxe7qYY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_03-19da5fea4d0349ce984f52a11493d337.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> As a Wi-Fi mesh extender, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 will automatically replicate the SSID of your router’s existing Wi-Fi networks and seamlessly keep you connected whenever you’re in range of either.

That’s definitely on the higher end for an extender.</p><p> Should you really spend that much on an extender? If you don’t already have a new Wi-Fi 6 router, then probably not. You might see higher peaks of speed as I did, but rather than trying to mix and match old and new tech, you’re probably better off investing in a new Wi-Fi mesh system that can cover the entire house.

The Nighthawk X6S (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Wi-Fi-Range-Extender-EX8000/dp/B074F3M2W8/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846125%7Cn35b11b2c61b54fa1a2d951691d1a61ed04%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) doesn’t have that, but it does deliver excellent 5GHz range and has four Gigabit Ethernet ports for wired devices. The Nighthawk AX8 is more future-proof as a result, but at a greater cost that becomes increasingly difficult to justify the higher, it climbs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Only for early adopters with Wi-Fi 6 routers and devices.</strong></p><p> If you’ve already bought a Wi-Fi 6 router and need a little help extending your signal into further corners of your home and&#x2F;or property, then the Nighthawk AX 8 (EAX 80) is the extender you’ll want.

Amazon makes checking out multiple brands fairly easy, but we’re also partial to other online retailers like Newegg and Best Buy. Most manufacturers like Apple, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and others have websites that you can buy laptops directly from, as well.</li><li>Where to buy a laptop for the best warranty?<br> If the warranty is your biggest concern, your best bet is to buy a laptop directly from the manufacturer so you can take advantage of their warranty support and customer service. Other online retailers like Amazon have their own customer service and offer 30-day returns, but you’ll still have to go through the manufacturer for any defects or issues that crop up later. HP and Dell are particularly reliable for warranty and support services, and Apple’s widespread store footprint makes it easy to bring your MacBook in for repairs and servicing. The Best Buy Geek Squad also offers repair and support services, and you have the option of picking up extended warranties from them.</li><li>Where are the cheapest places to buy laptops?<br> For those on a tight budget, buying directly from Apple or Dell may not be the best option. If you’re willing to pick up a certified refurbished device, you can find plenty of options on Amazon. Alternatively, you can buy lightly used laptops from eBay, Swappa, Facebook Marketplace, and other secondhand selling sites. That said, you won’t get a warranty and the purchase will be at your own risk, so your best bet may be to wait until a big sale such as back to school,<a class="link"

It also tips the scales at over five pounds, which is definitely on the heavy side for a 15.6” laptop.</p><p> The body, lid, and bezel are all plastic, which feels a bit cheap to the touch. But it does have a pleasant brushed pattern that breaks the monotony of the basic black case, and the interior deck features a textured metallic finish that looks and feels significantly better than the rest of the laptop.</p><p> On the right side of the Aspire E 15, you’ll find the power jack, headphone jack, a USB 2.0 port, and a DVD burner. The SD card reader is located on the front of the device, alongside the LED indicator lights. On the left side is the VGA port that Acer still loves to throw on everything, an HDMI port, two USB 3.0 ports, an ethernet jack, and a USB port.</p><p>Aesthetics may be the Acer Aspire E 15’s weakest area.</p><p> The keyboard is roomy and comfortable and the keys feel sharp and springy. The trackpad is massive and responsive, but it doesn’t feel as robust as the keyboard. The left and right buttons are incorporated into the main body of the trackpad, and they have far too much give—if we pressed down with more than the absolute minimum necessary force, it felt like the trackpad might collapse.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-A-ton-of-bloatware-to-remove"><a href="#Setup-Process-A-ton-of-bloatware-to-remove" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: A ton of bloatware to remove"></a><strong>Setup Process:</strong> <strong>A ton of bloatware to remove</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 comes with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217" >Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> preloaded, and the setup process isn’t really anything out of the ordinary for a Windows 10 laptop. Acer requests some contact information during the initial setup, which is something that most of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-oem-software-1701736" >OEMs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> do to help with warranties and support. We timed the process from start to finish, and it took about 10 minutes to go from plugging it in and turning it on, to hitting the desktop for the first time.</p><p> Once you finish the initial setup, most users will also want to take additional time to remove the substantial amount of bloatware that comes preinstalled. This isn’t necessary but is something that most users will probably want to do, and it does add quite a bit of time to the setup process if you opt to go that route.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/M-q3UXEJ6htBtTcwPWAH9SLwJeI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1lW4043278-Acer-Aspire-4-1cfdfcc543fa4eb5b5e5449b6ea37413.jpg"                      alt="Acer Aspire E 15"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Display-Full-HD-display-with-awesome-contrast-but-washed-out-color"><a href="#Display-Full-HD-display-with-awesome-contrast-but-washed-out-color" class="headerlink" title="Display: Full HD display with awesome contrast but washed-out color"></a><strong>Display: Full HD display with awesome contrast but washed-out color</strong></h2><p> While the Aspire E 15’s screen isn’t the brightest or most colorful in the world, it is a full HD display that absolutely shines compared to the low-resolution screens found on a lot of laptops in this category.</p><p> The display has decent viewing angles and great contrast, but the colors are a bit washed out. It’s fine for watching videos on YouTube and Netflix—and DVDs, of course—but it wouldn’t be our first choice for movie night. It’s definitely a display that’s best suited for work, with media and gaming as afterthoughts.</p><h2 id="Performance-Outperforms-the-competition-but-suffers-from-a-slow-HDD"><a href="#Performance-Outperforms-the-competition-but-suffers-from-a-slow-HDD" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Outperforms the competition, but suffers from a slow HDD"></a><strong>Performance: Outperforms the competition, but suffers from a slow HDD</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 suffers a bit from a slow hard drive, and it could stand to have a bit more RAM, but it performs exceedingly well for a laptop in this category. It beats most of the competition in all important benchmarks and is a joy to use for productivity tasks, web browsing, and even light<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1000-4148125" >gaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 is available in two basic configurations. The unit we tested was the less expensive of the two, featuring an Intel Core i3-8130U running at 2.2 GHz, an Intel UHD Graphics 620 GPU, and 6GB DDR3L RAM. The more expensive configuration comes with a Core i7 processor, a discrete<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161" >Nvidia graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , more RAM, and an SSD, so it performs even better.</p><p> We ran the PCMark 10 benchmark, and the Aspire E 15 recorded an overall score of 2,657. It did best in the essentials category, with a score of 5,097, and slightly worse in productivity and digital content creation with scores of 4,534 and 2,203 respectively. In comparison, the similarly-priced Lenovo Ideapad 320 managed an overall score of just 1,062.</p><p> The full HD screen and snappy performance make productivity tasks a breeze.</p><p> So how does that score translate into the real world? It means the Aspire E 15 opens apps without a lot of lag, is capable of multitasking without bogging down, and can juggle more than a dozen web browser windows without skipping a beat, even if you’re streaming video.</p><p> We also ran a few gaming benchmarks from 3DMark, with slightly less stellar results. The first one we tried was Fire Strike, which is designed for gaming laptops. It only managed a score of 855 in that benchmark, running at just 4 FPS during the graphics test and 17 FPS during the physics test.</p><p> That was significantly better than other laptops we tested in this category, but the integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620 GPU was definitely a bottleneck.</p><p> We also ran the Cloud Gate benchmark, which is designed for low end desktops and basic laptops. That resulted in a score of 6,492 at 36 FPS, indicating that the Aspire E 15 is capable of basic gaming.</p><p> Next up, we installed Steam and fired up Capcom’s blockbuster hit Monster Hunter for a true torture test. Astoundingly, the game was almost playable. It took forever to load into Astera due to the slow HDD, but we set out on a short expedition anyway. The game ran at between 20 and 30 FPS the whole time, but found that the action really bogged down with a big monster on the screen.</p><p> The takeaway is that we absolutely wouldn’t recommend buying this laptop for the purpose of playing games, but it is capable of rising to the task if you’re willing to lower the settings and stick to older games.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Productivity-Gets-the-job-done-at-work-home-or-on-the-go"><a href="#Productivity-Gets-the-job-done-at-work-home-or-on-the-go" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Gets the job done at work, home, or on the go"></a><strong>Productivity: Gets the job done at work, home, or on the go</strong></h2><p> The Aspire E 15 is designed with productivity in mind.

The keyboard is comfortable and responsive, which is great for long typing sessions, and the fantastic battery life means that you can unplug for an entire work or school day without worrying about power.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4621764&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/img/page-home.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0j4qIM8N-IXUlX66rWrHmqZTjxQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1lW4043278-Acer-Aspire-3-8bdb945a491f4f4cbab64c65fa21d9af.jpg"                      alt="Acer Aspire E 15"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Audio-Decent-speakers-but-no-bass-response"><a href="#Audio-Decent-speakers-but-no-bass-response" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Decent speakers, but no bass response"></a><strong>Audio: Decent speakers, but no bass response</strong></h2><p> The speakers are decent enough, but the audio quality is still one of the Aspire E 15’s weaker points. They just don’t get all that loud, and when we did crank the volume all the way up, we noticed a bit of distortion in some frequency ranges. There isn’t a whole lot of bass, either, so everything sounds a little tinny—and that only gets worse at louder volumes.</p><p> Strangely enough, the audio is actually louder and clearer when the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/14-16-inch-laptops-833846" >laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is sitting on a flat surface. It seems like there is a lot of sound escaping from the vents as well as through the actual speaker grills, and placing it on a solid surface seems to improve the audio quality.</p><h2 id="Network-Great-speeds-on-both-5-GHz-and-2-4-GHz-networks"><a href="#Network-Great-speeds-on-both-5-GHz-and-2-4-GHz-networks" class="headerlink" title="Network: Great speeds on both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz networks"></a><strong>Network: Great speeds on both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz networks</strong></h2><p> The Aspire E 15 includes a wireless card that’s capable of connecting to both 2.4 and 5 GHz wireless networks, which is a nice touch if you have a wireless router that lets you take advantage of this feature. 2.4 and 5 GHz network compatibility is standard on more expensive laptops, but a lot of competitors in the budget category leave it out.</p><p> Acer advertises a 12-hour battery life, and we found that to be a pretty accurate claim.</p><p> We found that the Aspire E 15 was able to achieve download speeds of 260 Mbps and upload speeds of 65 Mbps when connected to our 5 GHz network. When connected to our 2.4 GHz network, it notched speeds of 66 Mbps down and 64 Mbps up. These speeds are pretty good across the board.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-office-pdf-editor-1x.890dbda.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-720p-webcam-takes-grainy-stills"><a href="#Camera-720p-webcam-takes-grainy-stills" class="headerlink" title="Camera: 720p webcam takes grainy stills"></a><strong>Camera: 720p webcam takes grainy stills</strong></h2><p> The included webcam is capable of capturing 720p video, and while it works well enough for basic video calls on Skype or Discord, it may not be up to the standards necessary for professional video conferencing. It also takes grainy still images, although that may not be a huge concern unless you really need to take<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with your webcam for some reason.</p><h2 id="Battery-Fantastic-battery-life-that-goes-all-day"><a href="#Battery-Fantastic-battery-life-that-goes-all-day" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Fantastic battery life that goes all day"></a><strong>Battery: Fantastic battery life that goes all day</strong></h2><p> The battery in the Aspire E 15 is exceptional, especially compared to the mediocre offerings found in similarly-priced competitors. Acer advertises a 12-hour battery life, and we found that to be a pretty accurate claim.</p><p> Under ideal conditions (and with extremely light use) we found that the battery lasted about 14 hours in our testing. You’re unlikely to achieve this in everyday scenarios, but that’s the baseline maximum you could expect it to last.</p><p> Subjected to normal levels of use—constantly on with the brightness lowered and power management set to favor battery life—we found that the battery lasts about eight and a half hours. With similar settings, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a full day of work or school out of this laptop.</p><p> In a category where a lot of competing devices die out after four or five hours, that’s pretty remarkable.</p><h2 id="Software-Bogged-down-by-bloatware"><a href="#Software-Bogged-down-by-bloatware" class="headerlink" title="Software: Bogged down by bloatware"></a><strong>Software: Bogged down by bloatware</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 comes with Windows 10, some basic Windows apps, and a free trial of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-office-365-4589808" >Microsoft 365 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It also comes with a whole bunch of bloatware from Acer, Netflix, Evernote, an outdated version of Firefox, and several games you probably won’t want or need.</p><p> If you’re a Firefox user, it might be nice to have that already downloaded (just remember to update it immediately). But the rest of this bloatware is most likely going to be an annoyance that needs to get uninstalled.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35038891&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.dupinout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DupInOut-New-Duplicate-Scan-Tab.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Extremely-competitive-pricing"><a href="#Price-Extremely-competitive-pricing" class="headerlink" title="Price: Extremely competitive pricing"></a><strong>Price: Extremely competitive pricing</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of just $380, the Aspire E 15 is a fantastic deal. If you can get it for even less than that, then it’s truly a steal. The more expensive configuration with an SSD, discrete graphics, and Core i7, is also a good deal at an MSRP of $599 if you have a little more room in your budget.</p><h2 id="Competition-Blows-the-competition-out-of-the-water-in-almost-every-category"><a href="#Competition-Blows-the-competition-out-of-the-water-in-almost-every-category" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Blows the competition out of the water in almost every category"></a><strong>Competition: Blows the competition out of the water in almost every category</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 beats most of the competition in its price range thanks to superior hardware. It has a full HD screen, where competitors like the HP Notebook 15 and Lenovo Ideapad 320, priced at $288 and $299 respectively, both have 1366 x 768 displays. The Aspire E 15 also has more RAM than either of those laptops, a better CPU, and faster Wi-Fi speeds.</p><p> The Aspire E 15 also beats the competition, hands down, in battery life. While the Aspire E 15 can last for 12 hours, the HP Notebook 15 and Ideapad 320 both putter out at around the five-hour mark.</p><p> One thing the Aspire E 15 doesn’t have is a touchscreen, which can be found in some budget laptops. For example, the HP 15-BS013DX is priced in the sub-$500 category, and it includes a touchscreen.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hp-notebook-15-review-4686698" >HP Notebook 15 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Worth buying (and spending extra for the upgraded version if you can).</strong></p><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 hits almost all the right notes while keeping the price way, way down. If you have a little room in your budget, it’s worth investing in the more expensive configuration of this laptop, which comes with a discrete NVIDIA graphics card for gaming, extra RAM, and a speedy SSD.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-chromebook-c202sa-review-4589359" >Asus Chromebook C202SA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-go-review-4690827" >Microsoft Surface Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-ideapad-320-review-4686723" >Lenovo Ideapad 320 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39694080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/nbr/fire/Screenshot_1red_gb.jpg"                      border="0"                >Nero Burning ROM:<br>The ultimate burning program for all your needs!</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Aspire E 15</li><li>Product Brand  Acer</li><li>SKU  E5-576-392H</li><li>Price  $329.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  15 x 10.2 x 1.19 in.</li><li>Storage  1 TB HDD</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i3-8130U, 2.2 GHz</li><li>Compatibility  Windows</li><li>RAM  6GB DDR3L</li><li>Camera  0.9 MP webcam</li><li>Display  15.6” 1920 x 1080</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/torment-tides-of-numenera-critique-where-science-fiction-meets-epic-worldbuilding-in-gaming/"><u>'Torment: Tides of Numenera' Critique: Where Science Fiction Meets Epic Worldbuilding in Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-tailored-video-experience-creating-a-structured-watch-later-list-on-youtube/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Tailored Video Experience  Creating a Structured 'Watch Later' List on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-bring-a-smile-simple-meme-creation-with-kapwing/"><u>[New] Bring a Smile  Simple Meme Creation With Kapwing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-most-effective-ways-to-log-youtube-live-events/"><u>[New] In 2024, Most Effective Ways to Log YouTube Live Events</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-preserving-the-pixels-how-to-download-animated-tweets-from-twitter/"><u>[New] In 2024, Preserving the Pixels  How To Download Animated Tweets From Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-unfreezing-photo-booth-recordings-a-guide-to-smoother-playback/"><u>[New] Unfreezing Photo Booth Recordings  A Guide to Smoother Playback</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-the-seven-best-youtube-live-streaming-tools-for-iphoneandroid/"><u>[New] Unveiling  The Seven Best YouTube Live Streaming Tools for iPhone/Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-infinite-professional-slideshow-resource-for-businesses-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Infinite Professional Slideshow Resource for Businesses for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-the-best-10-vector-stock-pools/"><u>[Updated] Navigating the Best 10 Vector Stock Pools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-5-recorder-picks-to-freeze-your-web-wanderings-in-time/"><u>2024 Approved  Top 5 Recorder Picks to Freeze Your Web Wanderings in Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/a-fusion-of-analog-charm-and-digital-sophistication-unveiling-our-comprehensive-review-of-withings-move-smartwatches/"><u>A Fusion of Analog Charm & Digital Sophistication -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you travel with any regularity or use your devices considerably outside of the home or an office, then it’s well worth having a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-portable-laptop-battery-4050506" >portable laptop battery charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> around for when your phone runs low or you need a little more work time before your laptop shuts off. ZMI’s PowerPack 20000 is one of the best all-around options on the market today, providing a sizable cell with speedy charging across phones, tablets, laptops, portable game systems, and more, plus a slim design and great price.</p><p> I tested ZMI’s PowerPack 20000 time and again over more than a week across multiple devices, measuring the charging speeds and comparing it to other similar power banks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jITowxAWHBUo5WF3Y-XI6lKQNQE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/zmi-05-02d76c869b864ef0abddfe824cfbf53a.jpg"                      alt="ZMI PowerPack 20000"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Design-Small-but-powerful"><a href="#Design-Small-but-powerful" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small but powerful"></a><strong>Design: Small but powerful</strong></h2><p> The ZMI PowerPack 20000’s size is easily one of its biggest selling points. While it is a little heavy at 14.3 ounces, this power bank is the approximate width and height of a large smartphone, measuring up very closely to the size of my Apple iPhone 11 Pro at 6.3 x 3.2 inches (HWD). Of course, the 0.8-inch thickness is quite a bit larger than any phone today, but unlike most laptop-friendly charging banks, ZMI’s can still fit into a pocket or handbag with ease.</p><p> It’s smooth navy blue aluminum on the outside with a black plastic strip running along the entire frame, with one<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Power Delivery 2.0 port and two USB-A ports on one end. Nearby on the upper right side frame is a power button and four small lights that indicate how much power the bank is currently holding.</p><p> Unlike most laptop-friendly charging banks, ZMI’s can still fit into a pocket or handbag with ease.</p><p> The button also serves another very handy purpose: press it twice in a row and you’ll enable USB devices to be used by a connected computer. I plugged the ZMI PowerPack 20000 into a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/huawei-matebook-x-pro-signature-edition-review-4845244" >Huawei MateBook X Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> laptop and then plugged a USB mouse into the power bank, pressed the button twice, and then was able to use the mouse on the laptop. That’s incredibly helpful for slim, premium laptops that have very few ports.</p><p> This power bank doesn’t have an AC port for full-sized power plugs, as some competing power banks do, but it also costs less and is much smaller than those alternatives typically are.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vaINPELrwcWnOZDsX1ztKkCouww=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/zmi-03-1530f666df824f6281040c2ae3285eb2-2e7956941b91403aa888795a7e5e2e33.jpeg"                      alt="ZMI PowerPack 20000"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4742929&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/boxshot(2).png"                      border="0"                >Kanto Player Professional</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-does-it"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-does-it" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy does it"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy does it</strong></h2><p> There’s not much to the setup process here. Using the included USB-C to USB-C cable, simply plug one end into the power bank and the other into an AC adapter that you have handy—like one for a laptop, tablet, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Once the four lights on the side are fully illuminated, then the battery pack is fully charged.

I charged a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2019-review-4770116" >2019 MacBook Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (13-inch) laptop from 0 percent to 100 percent in just 1 hour, 53 minutes using the ZMI PowerPack 20000’s USB-C PD port, with an effective charging rate of 42.92W (14.8Vx2.9A). When the charging process was complete, the PowerPack still had one light illuminated, indicating that there was still a little bit of battery life remaining.</p><p> In a separate test, I had the ZMI PowerPack 20000 power the MacBook Pro as it played a locally-downloaded movie on loop at full brightness. With the PowerPack plugged in, the laptop maintained its 100 percent charge for 8 hours, 4 minutes before the power bank ran out of juice.</p><p> The PowerPack 20000 also charged a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-4685690" >Samsung Galaxy S10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smartphone from nothing to 100 percent in 1 hour, 47 minutes using the USB-C PD port, with four lights still remaining on the power bank.

Granted, the maximum USB-C PD output of 45W won’t charge some super-powered laptops—but for compatible laptops, as well as smartphones, tablets, and other portable electronics, it’s very well priced.</p><p> With larger laptop-friendly battery packs sometimes selling for well north of $100, the $70 price point of the ZMI PowerPack 20000 is an incredibly attractive deal.</p><h2 id="ZMI-PowerPack-20000-vs-Mophie-Powerstation-AC"><a href="#ZMI-PowerPack-20000-vs-Mophie-Powerstation-AC" class="headerlink" title="ZMI PowerPack 20000 vs Mophie Powerstation AC"></a><strong>ZMI PowerPack 20000 vs Mophie Powerstation AC</strong></h2><p> ZMI’s PowerPack 20000 is about half the size and weight of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mophie-powerstation-ac-review-5071990" >Mophie Powerstation AC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GYSBVR?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5071991%7Cn210c12f6fa164d19b551ef300c5549c018%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), which has a AC power port on one end, not to mention a larger 24,000mAh cell. Those are both stellar benefits, plus the fabric-lined exterior gives it a distinctive allure. That said, Mophie’s pack sells for $200, and we’d only recommend it if you must have the AC power outlet for charging a power-hungry laptop. If the ZMI PowerPack 20000 will meet your charging needs, however, it’s a much better bargain.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A fantastic portable laptop battery charger for nearly everyone.</strong></p><p> It’s honestly difficult to find anything to complain about with the ZMI PowerPack 20000. It’s powerful and does a great job of charging laptops and phones, it has enough capacity to handle those tasks with ease, it’s compact and well-designed, and the price is fantastic. It’s half the size of the giant Anker power brick that I’ve brought on my last two international trips and can handle all of the same tasks. In other words,<em>this</em> is the power brick I’m bringing on my next trip.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

On top of this, OLED frames are thinner and lighter than their LED predecessors. It’s a powerful combination that makes for a startlingly realistic picture alongside an expanded range of placement options. In the case of the LG C9, it’s a design that’s as smart as it is sleek thanks to the inclusion of Google Assistant and Alexa.</p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED 65-inch C9 (OLED65C9PUA).</p><p> The LG C9 itself is comprised of a pane of glass that covers the OLED panel. This pane stretches across the front of the TV, leaving a remarkable 0.3 inches between the end of the OLED panel and the metal edge. When it is mounted on a wall, the C9 looks fantastic thanks to this slim, bezel-less design, and while it boasts an impressive 65-inch screen, at no point does this top-of-the-line model exceed a width of 1.8 inches.</p><p> For customers with multiple external devices, such as Blu-ray players or gaming consoles, ports are located along the TV’s left-hand side and directly on its backside. These connection options include 4<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 2.1 ports, 3<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, one cable&#x2F;antenna input, one LAN port, and audio connections. The HDMI 2.1 ports are especially important since consoles began emerging in 2020 that rely on HDMI 2.1 such as the Playstation 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mxKfDJGuIKYcsSIQoKfzwDbYYmg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_02-3da87ff8439343f691cf02e9234d1f04.jpg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand"><a href="#Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand"></a><strong>Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand</strong></h2><p> Due to its large size and fragile nature, consider where the LG C9 will be most secure before moving ahead with setup. It shouldn’t be placed anywhere where there’s a risk it could be knocked down or climbed on, for instance, so choose a location safely tucked away from pets and children.</p><p> Setup options include securing the TV to the wall or using the provided stand as a table mount. Be careful, however, as the slim frame means that it needs to be handled with care regardless of where it’s placed, otherwise the TV is at risk of bending which could damage the OLED panel. You’ll want to make sure you’ve got an extra pair of hands for any lifting or adjusting in order to ensure its safety.</p><p> The LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended.</p><p> We found the mounting setup process to be straightforward for an afternoon DIY project. When choosing a wall mount, be sure to consider your individual needs as not all mounts are compatible with all building materials. If you have a plaster or masonry, for instance, you’re going to need stronger hardware than a typical mount has to offer. If you have drywall then the majority of TV mounts will be compatible with your home.</p><p> The other important factor when selecting a mount is the weight and screen size the mount is capable of holding. In this case, these measurements are 65 inches and 56 pounds. After this, considerations are based on preferences rather than hardware limitations. Do you want your mount to be fixed or flexible? Would you prefer installing the TV at eye level or would you like it to rest higher? Will you be placing it in a corner or on a flat wall? These are important questions to ask because they influence the kind of mount you’ll bring home. When in doubt, most manufacturers include a compatibility check for the TV’s make and model on their website. If you’re not comfortable measuring, leveling, and drilling into studs, it’s well worth the peace of mind to hire a handyman once you’ve made your selection.</p><p> Once the TV has been installed, LG’s WebOS guides the first-time setup process by prompting inputs for settings ranging from time zone and language up to and including any necessary user agreements. The LG C9 will complete a scan in order to identify the devices and then you’re free to customize the TV’s settings by pressing the gear button on the LG Magic Remote. The first setting we changed was the Auto Power Saving (APS) picture mode, which reduces power use by dimming the brightness of the TV. The other important setting to disable is TruMotion, which smooths motion in TV shows and movies by altering the frame rate of the programming. If your LG’s picture looks a bit too much like a soap opera, chances are you need to disable this setting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BGmail%2BBackup"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/gmail-backup.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Stunning-picture"><a href="#Image-Quality-Stunning-picture" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Stunning picture"></a><strong>Image Quality: Stunning picture</strong></h2><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off. Even from wide viewing angles, the 4K picture maintains its excellence, with limited washing out and color loss.</p><p> John Wick’s dynamic action scenes and stunning backdrops shine through in gorgeous, gritty detail in_Parabellum_ ; magical realism pops off the screen in Elton John’s biopic_Rocketman_ ; and the intricate wonders of the natural world appear in extraordinarily sharp detail in_Planet Earth II_ .</p><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off.</p><p> These pictures are further enhanced with LG’s α9 Gen 2 intelligent processor, new to 2019’s model. It excels at drawing out detail and correcting quality discrepancies within the picture, such as banding which creates textures and strips in areas of the screen that would otherwise be smooth. This is particularly important given the large screen size and high resolution. While it’s not as bright as an LED TV since it lacks backlighting, it doesn’t need it as the TV already possesses excellent color, a change here would risk washing out the inky blacks on the screen.</p><h2 id="Audio-Better-than-expected"><a href="#Audio-Better-than-expected" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Better than expected"></a><strong>Audio: Better than expected</strong></h2><p> While OLED TVs aren’t generally known for their great sound quality, the LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended. Audio in TV or movies is generally good, but it struggles to regulate loud and soft noises in a scene. Streaming Lizzo’s_Cuz I Love You_ on Spotify produces a surprising depth of sound, but it’s simply not comparable to a more robust system that a soundbar or home theater system would provide.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4610657&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/emeditor_chat_ai.png"                      border="0"                ><br>EmEditor is a fast, lightweight, yet extensible, easy-to-use text editor, code editor, CSV editor, and large file viewer for Windows.

It’s a user-friendly interface that makes navigating the TV incredibly smooth, enabling you to switch between apps and features built into the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with ease. Meanwhile, the LG Magic Remote can function as a traditional remote control, as a mouse would for a computer screen, or issue voice commands with Google Assistant and Alexa, making navigating the menus second nature. While most major streaming services are already included (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, to name a few) it’s also possible to download additional apps through the LG store. The drawback to the store, however, is that the apps are somewhat limited in availability.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon’s Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It makes it easy to search content, switch between apps and features, or check the weather, among other things. These controls extend into your home as well, enabling you to make use of any basic home control features already in place like updating the temperature on your Nest Smart Thermostat. You simply choose which assistant you want at a given time by pressing either the Amazon button on the Magic Remote to toggle Alexa or the microphone button to toggle Google Assistant.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with Google Assistant as well as Amazon’s Alexa.

The LG C9 is a premium 4K TV that sits at the top of this curve, offering integrated smart technologies and excellent picture with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface. As such, it comes at a premium price of $2,500 (Amazon) that exceeds the cost of many competitor models, but with so many additional features it’s worth the high price—even if it’s difficult to swallow.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-60-inch-tvs-4580159" >How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19080710&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smart-seo-tool.com/images/SmartSEOAuditorBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R"><a href="#LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R" class="headerlink" title="LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R"></a><strong>LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R</strong></h2><p> It’s easy to see why the LG C9 is such an attractive model. Between its many bells and whistles, it offers superior quality at a premium price. For users looking for a more down-to-earth price point, QLED TV models offer great picture quality at a lower cost and are a major competitor for OLED models.</p><p> The Samsung 65-Inch Class Q60R (QN65Q60RAFXZA) is a QLED TV that relies on edge lighting behind its screen to transmit light. This light shines through quantum dots within the LED panel which then transmit color through to the screen and create a picture. This differs from the LG C9 model which toggles pixels on and off individually to create inkier blacks and better contrast. While this isn’t a deal breaker for the Q60R, it does mean that the LG C9 panel will have a little more punch since it’s better equipped to balance bright whites with darker blacks.</p><p> If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> The Q60R also uses Bixby, Samsung’s AI assistant. Unfortunately, the Bixby integration feels somewhat clunky. It’s not uncommon to repeat instructions when Bixby has difficulty understanding basic instructions. The other caveat to be aware of is that the picture does wash out slightly and lose color when looked at from wide viewing angles. If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> Unlike OLED models, QLED models aren’t prone to burn-in. This is a condition where discoloration occurs over a portion of the screen. This happens when OLED TVs are left on the same channel for extensive periods of time. The Q60R also doubles as an excellent gaming TV or monitor thanks to its variable refresh rates and low input lag which allows the screen to adjust the refresh rate to that of the source. While the C9 also has a variable refresh rate and a low input lag, its variable refresh rate is only compatible with the Xbox One for now since nothing else uses HDMI 2.1 yet. Generally retailing for around $1,000, the Q60R is less than half the cost of the LG C9, making it a better choice for those concerned about price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-q60r-series-qled-4k-tv-review-4782061" >Samsung Q60R Series QLED 4K TV Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An excellent TV you shouldn’t hesitate to buy if you value ease of use and superb image quality.</strong></p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED C9. That said, these improvements aren’t significant leaps, mainly coming from processor improvements and the addition of HDMI 2.1 ports. If you’re simply looking for the best TV from last year and price isn’t a consideration, look no further.

Newer smartphones and laptops are implementing support for the standard, and new Wi-Fi routers are being released to supply those benefits.</p><p> If you don’t already have one of those new Wi-Fi 6 routers, should you spend extra for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 to futureproof your setup? Here’s what I think after testing the device for several days across everyday web usage, media streaming, playing online games, and more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Pretty-awkward"><a href="#Design-Pretty-awkward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Pretty awkward"></a><strong>Design: Pretty awkward</strong></h2><p> The Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is not only the largest and heaviest Wi-Fi extender I’ve tested at 10 inches tall and nearly two pounds, but it’s also one of the oddest-looking. It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward. Also, the little plastic feet don’t do a great job of supporting the weight, making it a bit wobbly on a flat surface.</p><p> With very large sides, the front is really just a small panel with light-up LED indicators showing connectivity details and which Ethernet ports are in use. There’s also a small WPS button beneath the LED panel for easy connectivity with a router. On the wider back panel are the four wired<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for plugging in devices such as game consoles and computers, as well as a USB 3.0 port, DC power port, and the power button itself.</p><p> It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app"><a href="#Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Avoid the app"></a><strong>Setup Process: Avoid the app</strong></h2><p> The setup options for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 are the same as with Netgear’s other extenders—even those without Wi-Fi 6 support. You’ll begin with the extender plugged in near your router. If your router supports<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wps-4842308" >WPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , then you can pair the extender with it easily by following the process listed in the included booklet, which is as simple as pressing a button on the router and then doing the same on the extender.</p><p> If that’s not an option, or you’d rather follow a step-by-step process with prompts, then you can set it up using either a mobile (iOS or Android) app or a web browser on your computer.</p><p> The mobile app has been unreliable in my experience with other Netgear extenders, but it was much worse when setting up the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The app repeatedly could not connect with the created mesh network on the extender during setup, and I had to factory reset the device multiple times to start again.</p><p> Over and over, the setup process wouldn’t complete… and then it finally did. I ran into similar issues with the other Netgear extenders, in which setup processes didn’t work as expected on the first or second time, but this was a much longer and more arduous ordeal. Finally, however, I got the Nighthawk AX8 up and running. From there, you’ll need to find a new location for the extender—roughly halfway between the router and your Wi-Fi dead zone is ideal, but play around with positioning if you’re not getting the results you seek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xru8JLL_UOk3sXBYpbrOyAl-ihc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_02-b120eab8816746338c53e4eb1cfc62d6.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Smooth-sailing"><a href="#Connectivity-Smooth-sailing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Smooth sailing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Smooth sailing</strong></h2><p> Once through the hassle of setup, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender really did deliver strong performance. I tested the connection in my office, which reliably sees reduced 5GHz reception from my router due to obstructions in between, and saw a noticeable boost in both reception and speed.</p><p> In one test, I registered a 5GHz speed of 246Mbps with the extender, which was the fastest wireless speed I’ve seen anywhere in my house using that older, TP-Link router. Given that, I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The router isn’t Wi-Fi 6 compatible, but I still saw higher top-end speeds than ever before.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender also performed pretty well in distance testing. In another instance, I registered a 5GHz download speed of 87Mbps with my office, and then measured the speeds from my backyard at approximate distance intervals from the extender.</p><p> I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8.</p><p> That 5GHz signal dropped down to 77Mbps at 25 feet, 74Mbps at 50 feet, and 56Mbps at 25 feet—still pretty speedy from the farthest edge of my property. Meanwhile, the 2.4GHz signal started at just 42Mbps at that moment in my office, and dropped to 30Mbps at 25 feet, 28Mbps at 50 feet, and 26Mbps at 75 feet.</p><p> Given the high max speeds, it wasn’t surprising to see strong gaming performance, as well. While playing Rocket League, I saw smooth gameplay across the wired Ethernet connection as well as both wireless networks, with a ping as low as 33 via the wired connection. The wireless ping was only a few points higher.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1412049&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-200x200.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rtnI3hSe9qP5qFqjhu1LRxe7qYY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_03-19da5fea4d0349ce984f52a11493d337.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> As a Wi-Fi mesh extender, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 will automatically replicate the SSID of your router’s existing Wi-Fi networks and seamlessly keep you connected whenever you’re in range of either. That’s true even with non-Netgear routers and those without Wi-Fi 6 support, and it’s a huge benefit over some cheaper extenders that don’t keep the same network info intact across devices.</p><p> It’s billed as an “8-stream” device, so it should be able to handle several simultaneous media streams at once, with a billed max speed of 4.8Gbps on the 5GHz band and 1.2Gbps on the 2.4GHz band. It has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >MU-MIMO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (multiple users, multi-in multi-out) and beamforming capabilities, promising expanded range of up to 2,500 square feet and support for 30+ simultaneous devices.</p><p> If you don’t have a Wi-Fi 6 router, then you’ll either want to start there or consider investing in a Wi-Fi mesh system instead.</p><h2 id="Price-More-than-most"><a href="#Price-More-than-most" class="headerlink" title="Price: More than most"></a><strong>Price: More than most</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is listed at $250, although it’s being sold for $220 at multiple retailers as of this writing. That’s definitely on the higher end for an extender.</p><p> Should you really spend that much on an extender? If you don’t already have a new Wi-Fi 6 router, then probably not. You might see higher peaks of speed as I did, but rather than trying to mix and match old and new tech, you’re probably better off investing in a new Wi-Fi mesh system that can cover the entire house. Netgear’s Orbi is a favorite, as is Google’s similar Nest Wi-Fi system.</p><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)</strong></h2><p> Both of these Netgear Nighthawk Wi-Fi extenders will set you back $200 or more, and the key difference between them—aside from design—is the Wi-Fi 6 compatibility of the Nighthawk AX8. The Nighthawk X6S (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Wi-Fi-Range-Extender-EX8000/dp/B074F3M2W8/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846125%7Cn35b11b2c61b54fa1a2d951691d1a61ed04%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) doesn’t have that, but it does deliver excellent 5GHz range and has four Gigabit Ethernet ports for wired devices. The Nighthawk AX8 is more future-proof as a result, but at a greater cost that becomes increasingly difficult to justify the higher, it climbs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Only for early adopters with Wi-Fi 6 routers and devices.</strong></p><p> If you’ve already bought a Wi-Fi 6 router and need a little help extending your signal into further corners of your home and&#x2F;or property, then the Nighthawk AX 8 (EAX 80) is the extender you’ll want. But if you don’t have a Wi-Fi 6 router, then you’ll either want to start there or consider investing in a Wi-Fi<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178" >mesh system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead. Spending more than $200 on an extender doesn’t make much sense unless you’re adding it to a top-of-the-line system—and don’t mind the significant investment.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk EAX80 AX6000 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>SKU  EAX80</li><li>Price  $249.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  10 x 7.75 x 4.2 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Ports  4x Ethernet, 1x USB</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-earnings-explosion-how-to-maximize-income-on-youtube-shorts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Earnings Explosion  How to Maximize Income on YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-proper-techniques-for-exporting-photos-from-phone-to-snapchat/"><u>[New] In 2024, Proper Techniques for Exporting Photos From Phone to Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-ranking-the-top-10-stealth-story-fans/"><u>[New] Ranking the Top 10 Stealth Story Fans</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-vlcs-network-live-stream-capabilities/"><u>[New] Unveiling VLC's Network Live Stream Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-chuckling-chords-crafting-top-tier-meme-content/"><u>[Updated] Chuckling Chords  Crafting Top-Tier Meme Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-expanding-screen-coverage-of-youtube-videos/"><u>[Updated] Expanding Screen Coverage of YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-beyond-basics-why-hdr-dominates-in-video-editing-workflows/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Beyond Basics  Why HDR Dominates in Video Editing Workflows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-mini-movie-script-concept/"><u>[Updated] Mini Movie Script Concept</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-replace-missing-watch-playback-icons/"><u>[Updated] Replace Missing Watch Playback Icons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expert-tips-for-effortless-google-podcast-upload/"><u>2024 Approved  Expert Tips for Effortless Google Podcast Upload</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-seamless-google-meet-integration-for-youtube-enthusiasts/"><u>2024 Approved  Seamless Google Meet Integration for YouTube Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/a-critical-look-at-political-dynamics-in-tropico-6s-utopian-setting/"><u>A Critical Look at Political Dynamics in Tropico 6'S Utopian Setting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/a-guide-to-shopping-for-ideal-laptops-at-these-6-best-stores/"><u>A Guide to Shopping for Ideal Laptops at These 6 Best Stores</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/beat-overheating-the-deepcool-as5nplus-cpu-air-cooler-deal-for-below-45-on-amazon/"><u>Beat Overheating: The DeepCool AS5nplus CPU Air Cooler Deal for Below $45 on Amazon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/beyond-the-turing-test-exploring-five-advanced-techniques-for-measuring-machine-intelligence/"><u>Beyond the Turing Test: Exploring Five Advanced Techniques for Measuring Machine Intelligence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/capturing-your-lenovo-display-in-slow-motion-for-2024/"><u>Capturing Your Lenovo Display in Slow Motion for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/compare-all-ipads-like-a-pro-the-complete-ranking-and-spec-sheet/"><u>Compare All iPads Like a Pro: The Complete Ranking and Spec Sheet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comparing-samsung-galaxy-s10plus-with-s20-in-depth-review-and-analysis/"><u>Comparing Samsung Galaxy S10+ with S20: In-Depth Review & Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-alcatel-joy-tab-2-assessment-affordable-lte-tablet-guide/"><u>Comprehensive Alcatel Joy Tab 2 Assessment -

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> Although the core functionality is typically the same, laptop cooling pads come in a variety of designs and with different features. Some are robust and durable and may pack in additional perks, while some stick to the absolute basics, aiming to win out on pure bang for buck.</p><p> The TopMate C302 is a strong example of the latter. It’s affordable and solidly effective, but the plastic design feels a bit flimsy. I wouldn’t bet on it lasting for the long haul without gentle handling, but given the price, you might not worry about it too much.</p><h2 id="Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy"><a href="#Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Light and a little flimsy"></a>Design: Light and a little flimsy</h2><p> The C302 measures just over 14 inches wide and is designed for laptops with screens up to 15.6 inches diagonal. It’s primarily made of lightweight plastic, with a thin metal grate on the top above the two 4.9-inch fans to help dissipate heat.</p><p> The entire pad weighs only 1.1 pounds, but the downside to it being so lightweight is that it feels a bit flimsy and rickety. It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3qjwZzxQ2KVhmQJOdD2R9jBegvI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_03-ed7074949b6f4e4794ce30be2d582058.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> It has two little flip-up stopper nubs at the bottom to hold your laptop in place, and they can be gradually adjusted to avoid having them stick up and press into your wrists while typing. Meanwhile, a pair of feet on the bottom of the pad flip out to elevate your laptop about an inch upward to improve air circulation.</p><p> A single cable comes from the back of the pad to plug into a USB-A port on your computer, and it has a pass-through so that you can plug in another accessory, so as to not sacrifice a port simply to use the cooling pad. That’s handy.</p><p> It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p> The C302 has a little bit of accent lighting via a pair of blue lights beneath each fan, but it doesn’t emanate a significant glow, nor is it customizable in any way.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a>Setup Process: Plug and play</h2><p> The C302 is a purely plug-and-play accessory with no flashy perks or settings to deal with, nor any need for software on your computer. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the feet and holding nubs as desired, and plug the USB port into your computer to power on the pad. The fans will then activate and run at the only available speed, and you can unplug it when you’re done or don’t need it anymore.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xhFp_B4P4BG8gb4dtJAGBbXPAlw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_05-4ce850d84f4a4e1d931588e23f39cb82.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Performance-It-makes-a-difference"><a href="#Performance-It-makes-a-difference" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It makes a difference"></a>Performance: It makes a difference</h2><p> I tested the C302 using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) gaming laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is equipped with an Intel Core i7-9750H processor and 16GB RAM, as well as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU (6GB).</p><p> This lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Across two recent, popular games and a graphics-intensive benchmark test, I first tested the laptop on its own and recorded the internal processor temperature using the NZXT CAM app, as well as the external temperature of the laptop using an infrared thermometer. After allowing the laptop to cool down, I repeated the process with the cooling pad in use.</p><p> In Fortnite, the Razer Blade 15 recorded a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees Fahrenheit and 118 degrees externally, while the cooling pad dropped those numbers to 179 degrees internal and 115 degrees external.</p><p> In Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade 15 hit 184 degrees internally and 117° externally, and those figures dropped to 175 degrees internally and 100 degrees externally with the cooling pad. There was no significant performance difference in the Dirt 5 benchmark when using the cooling pad: The average FPS mark was within one frame with or without the pad in use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Xs71AyeThjZwy-vZJ9LfxIhuXJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_04-eadbaf270b874af9bb8843b95efe8ca7.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Lastly, UNIGINE’s Heaven Benchmark hit 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees externally on the Razer Blade 15 alone, and dropped to 154 degrees internally and 105 degrees externally when using the C302. All told, this lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Depending on test, the results were roughly comparable to or better than more expensive cooling pads, like the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad and Thermaltake Massive TM, which have some added features onboard. It’s also pretty quiet in use—certainly quieter than the Razer Blade 15’s own internal fans.</p><h2 id="Price-It’s-very-affordable"><a href="#Price-It’s-very-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s very affordable"></a>Price: It’s very affordable</h2><p> At $30, this is one of the most affordable laptop cooling pads on the market right now. While results varied across multiple tests and games&#x2F;apps, the C302 was pretty well in line with some of the pricier options I tested. It feels a little flimsy and doesn’t have any premium features, but the C302 is a very good entry-level option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3hXx9Tb9omnQS0YyIXmv97Lunr0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_02-8fc1ac2169044c0a82b61a80f63ef089.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> At $27, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a bit more robust. It gives you the ability to power the fans on and off—either the one large fan, or the group of four smaller fans around it—plus it runs a little quieter in use. The unit feels more durable overall, although the Kootek’s height adjustment system feels clunky, as you slide a hanging metal bar into plastic ridges to keep it upright. Kootek’s pad is larger and designed for laptops as large at 17 inches, but if you don’t need the extra size, the TopMate C302 gets the job done for less cash.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An ideal entry-level pick.</strong></p><p> Durability questions aside, the TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad ultimately worked about as well as the other, pricier pads I tested, helping to offset some of the heat generated by a very hot gaming laptop. If you’re concerned about long-term damage or performance degradation from an overheating laptop, the C302 is a cost-efficient way to help keep your notebook from reaching extreme heat peaks.</p><!--

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The in-car USB charger market is virtually flooded with offerings for virtually any taste to any<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-to-buy-for-under-300-4045957" >budget <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — from the cheap and chintzy to high-tech. The Anker PowerDrive 2 is one of the most popular chargers on the market, and it didn’t disappoint during our testing. In addition to its durable plastic construction, it includes a 3-foot micro<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-micro-usb-cables-4178845" >USB cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a dual-port design, and fast recharge rates for your devices thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology. Don’t let the diminutive blue<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desk-lamps-4135707" >LED light <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> fool you, the Anker PowerDrive 2 can put out enough power to recharge two iPads simultaneously. What’s more, it can do that without<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/problem-with-overheating-laptops-2377646" >overheating <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><h2 id="Design-All-plastic-but-sturdy-and-subtle"><a href="#Design-All-plastic-but-sturdy-and-subtle" class="headerlink" title="Design: All-plastic, but sturdy and subtle"></a><strong>Design: All-plastic, but sturdy and subtle</strong></h2><p> The Anker PowerDrive 2 might not be the sharpest or most cutting-edge looking in-car USB charger, but what it lacks in visual pizazz, it more than makes up for in sturdiness.</p><p> A lot of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-usb-port-not-charging-phone-4102780" >in-car USB chargers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are susceptible to slowly fragmenting. If you yank a USB cable out of the charger haphazardly, the charger might come apart (we encountered this with the RAVPower 24W USB charger). Not so with the Anker PowerDrive 2 which survived weeks of rigorous testing and careless USB cable unpluggings. It’s also fairly compact. It’ll protrude a bit from the 12V port, but it’s not very noticeable.</p><p> Don’t let the diminutive blue LED light fool you, the Anker PowerDrive 2 can put out enough power to recharge two iPads simultaneously.</p><p> That said, it’s not the prettiest charger. The black plastic construction is fine to look at and blends in nicely with most car interiors, but the red ring around the face makes it look a bit cheap. So, too, does the “IQ” logo printed between the two USB ports, but these are fairly minor quibbles. The PowerDrive 2 has a small and unobtrusive LED light to help you find the USB ports in the dark. We found it less distracting than other chargers we tested.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices"><a href="#Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices"></a><strong>Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices</strong></h2><p> The best part of the Anker PowerDrive 2 is its charging. It has the ability to charge iPads simultaneously without getting overheated thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology. Each USB port can output a maximum 5V&#x2F;2.4A, for a total of 24W. That’s in line with other car<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-phone-chargers-4138571" >chargers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we tested, but the PowerIQ technology can help identify device and deliver the fastest possible charge. This also gives you some overvoltage protection to make sure something like a smartwatch doesn’t fry when you plug it in.</p><p> This isn’t quite the same as Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 or other fast charge technologies which vary the voltage and amperage on a larger range, but it’ll top up your phone or other devices faster than a regular charger.</p><p> The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</p><p> One thing to note is that the PowerDrive 2 includes a micro USB cable, in case you don’t want to carry your device’s cable everywhere with you. That’s a nice touch we didn’t get with other chargers we tested.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1821134/17882" target="_top" id="1821134"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1821134"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1821134/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Middle-of-the-pack"><a href="#Price-Middle-of-the-pack" class="headerlink" title="Price: Middle of the pack"></a><strong>Price: Middle of the pack</strong></h2><p> The list price of $14.99 is positioned in the mid-range of the USB charger market, which ranges from just a few dollars to upwards of $50 for some fancier chargers. However, Anker PowerDrive 2 can be had for a discounted price on some websites. Considering the fact that the Anker PowerDrive 2 includes both the fast-charger and a 3-foot micro USB cable, it is well priced for the marketplace.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-A-handful-of-rivals"><a href="#Competition-A-handful-of-rivals" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A handful of rivals"></a><strong>Competition: A handful of rivals</strong></h2><p> The RAVPower 24W charger is one of Anker’s main rivals. It has a metal exterior, a lower price tag, and theoretically identical power output. However, its construction is far less robust. In fact, its metal outside easily separates from the internal components easily making Anker a better pick for longevity.</p><p> The Aukey CC-S1 charger is a much closer competitor. It has the standard dual 2.4A USB ports, is constructed from plastic, and costs a few dollars less. One advantage it has is that unlike the PowerDrive, the CC-S1 sits virtually flush to the 12V socket. But you don’t get LED lights, which might make it a hindrance to find at night.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ravpower-24w-usb-car-charger-review-4686799" >RAVPower 24W USB Car Charger Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</strong></p><p> The price is fair, the charging is fast, and the design is unobtrusive.

Serves me right I suppose.</p><p> If you live far enough from your local TV signal source that other indoor antennas have failed you, the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might actually provide some help. Buyers should probably make sure that they can’t get away with a smaller, cheaper, simpler solution first, but if or when that fails, this antenna definitely gets the job done.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vY1j7QoS0FLwOKNhPlSfR3XMlmo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_02-e97897fe03b74f5faa2eefad3b3b7208.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4535075&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/GU-500_672.png"                      border="0"                >Glary Utilities PRO -  Premium all-in-one utility to clean, speed up, maintain and protect your PC</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future"><a href="#Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Glimpsing an ugly future"></a><strong>Design: Glimpsing an ugly future</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna looks something like what I would imagine a space prison to look like. It’s far larger than any of the other antennas that I tested, and during every step of the assembly I kept thinking to myself “well that part can’t possibly be necessary.” From the comically long antennas and giant metal grate, to the bulbous hollowed out spheres, there is a lot going on here.</p><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup.</p><p> As you’ll see later though, this is because the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna doesn’t really care about looks. Everything is 100% about function. There are, however, a few little elements from a design perspective that help make the ClearStream a somewhat thoughtful device nonetheless. Once assembled, all the parts fit together nicely like a lego set.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BScreen%2BRecorder%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/f026b149-fc7c-fd54-5f3e-1460bbb19b6b.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Buckle-up"><a href="#Setup-Buckle-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Buckle up"></a><strong>Setup: Buckle up</strong></h2><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup. The instructions that come included have illustrations that show how everything fits together, but it isn’t outlined in the simplest manner possible.</p><p> Like a piece of IKEA furniture, the specific orientation of a lot of parts matter, even if they appear to fit together multiple ways. The manual doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining this, and I could see it leading to some frustration. Once you get the cage in place and secured, the rest of it comes together fairly easily though.</p><p> Once the entire device is assembled, the real work begins in my opinion. Now you have to figure out how and where to mount this beast of an antenna. Antenna’s Direct has you covered here, including a hefty bracket and swiveling mast that will help you mount the antenna to just about anywhere with a flat surface that you don’t mind screwing some bolts into.</p><h2 id="Performance-Top-tier"><a href="#Performance-Top-tier" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Top tier"></a><strong>Performance: Top tier</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception. I tested the antenna indoors along with the rest of the suite of indoor antennas, and in the same orientation. Perhaps it would have benefited from being placed outside, but in the interest of fairness I used the same method for all.</p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception.</p><p> In my channel acquisition test, the ClearStream managed 76 channels consistently, far and away the best result from any of the devices I tested. The worst antenna I tested picked up just 47 channels, and the second best, 69. Needless to say, all the wires, cages, and bulbous plastic spheres are clearly doing something here, because this was the best result I saw.</p><h2 id="Range-Extensive"><a href="#Range-Extensive" class="headerlink" title="Range: Extensive"></a><strong>Range: Extensive</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is rated for up to 60 miles. These ratings are generally based on relatively unobstructed paths between the signal and your device. There is a lot less than 60 miles between me and my local TV broadcast source, but if the other results are any indication, the ClearStream has a fighting chance at living up to these claims.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NoQoQy3-EFUpi1z9oMTpD2JGWHQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_04-70f5a48ac9a347d286c71240b85cbc1c.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap"><a href="#Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap"></a><strong>Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has a list price of $120 and a 90-day rolling average price on Amazon of $83. This is significantly more than any of the other antennas I tested, some of which could be had for around $25. If you live far enough that you need a better performing antenna, however, it could easily be worth every penny. I would only caution buyers to make sure they really do need this performance before pulling the trigger on this very large antenna.</p><h2 id="ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> I figured it might be interesting to compare the cheapest antenna to the most expensive antenna. If you are living inside of a city, fairly close to a signal source, you can probably get away with a cheaper antenna like the $25 amplified antenna by manufacturer 1byone. This flat, simple antenna takes up far less space and still managed to get 59 channels. It also maintained a clear picture on all of the major network stations just fine.</p><p> If you live further or in a more obstructed path, however, the 1byone probably wouldn’t cut it at all. It’s rather all-or-nothing. If you do genuinely need a more capable antenna, it could be make or break for your TV-viewing experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great performance for those that need it.</strong><br> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna isn’t the cheapest or best-looking antenna on the market, but it gets the job done better than any of the other antennas we tested. Buyers who know they need an antenna with better range and performance will find this to be a noticeable bump from cheaper indoor antennas.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is a 43-inch 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) television that’s built on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-4152887" >Amazon’s Fire TV platform <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , so it features<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-alexa-with-your-tv-4161152" >Alexa voice controls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the familiar Fire TV interface. In addition to 4K resolution, it also features<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-hdr-and-4k-4176961" >HDR support <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a decent number of HDMI ports, and built-in stereo speakers.</p><p> Insignia is Best Buy’s in-house budget brand, which calls for tempered expectations, but we were pleasantly surprised on a lot of fronts when we sat down to watch our test unit. We tested things like viewing angles, color reproduction, sound quality, and more to see if this budget Fire TV is really worth a sport in your living room.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MXH7eY7oDLeZbWXcastu1A7OhpQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-5-2ec275929e8543f0ab9c4ada6276d84c.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087267/19272" target="_top" id="2087267"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087267"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087267/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Thick-body-thick-bezel-but-light-enough-for-one-person-to-handle"><a href="#Design-Thick-body-thick-bezel-but-light-enough-for-one-person-to-handle" class="headerlink" title="Design: Thick body, thick bezel, but light enough for one person to handle"></a><strong>Design: Thick body, thick bezel, but light enough for one person to handle</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is thick and boxy, with a fairly wide bezel, and large feet that mount perpendicularly instead of angling like a lot of other inexpensive sets. It isn’t anything special to look at, but that’s to be expected from a budget line like Insignia. The good thing is that it’s fairly light, at less than 20 pounds, and the large feet make it quite steady.</p><p> Most of the ports are found on the left side of the set, as you face it, with a few of them oriented downward instead.</p><p> The power button is situated in a semi-translucent plastic bulge near one of the feet, making it easy to locate, and you can use the same button to switch inputs. There are no other physical buttons on this set, so don’t lose the remote.</p><p> When watching shows on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and HBO Now, dialogue came through crystal clear, and sound effects had enough substance that we didn’t feel the need to immediately plug in a soundbar or reach for our Bluetooth headphones.</p><p> This television uses a standard detachable C7 power cord instead of a hard-wired power cable, and it features a standard 200 x 200 millimeter<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tv-wall-mounts-3276137" >VESA mount <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to ditch the clunky feet and hang it on a wall.</p><p> While this set does have Alexa built right in, it works like a Fire TV Stick and not like a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-cube-4172274" >Fire TV Cube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-amazon-echo-4147189" >Echo device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . What that means is it lacks far-field microphones, so you have to give commands via the remote. The remote itself is the same basic design that’s included with other Fire TV devices, but it includes volume buttons, a live TV button, and preset shortcuts for a few streaming services.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8ovvGrqb8Me9IvWHrQc7UW02kw8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-4-acb78e6d55e4488ca394495d5c74c754.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803115/14559" target="_top" id="1803115"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803115"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803115/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-Phillips-screwdriver-and-your-Amazon-password"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-Phillips-screwdriver-and-your-Amazon-password" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a Phillips screwdriver and your Amazon password"></a><strong>Setup Process: You’ll need a Phillips screwdriver and your Amazon password</strong></h2><p> Despite being a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-43-inch-tvs-4588664" >43-inch class television <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is light enough for most people to handle and set up without any outside assistance. It’s even packed in a bag that has convenient handles, making it easy to lift up and out of the box and set carefully on a table for assembly.</p><p> This television comes more or less ready to go, but the feet have to be attached if you aren’t going to wall mount it. The feet are clearly marked as to which side needs to point toward the front of the television, and each one attaches with two Phillips screws. If you have a Phillips screwdriver at hand, you can have everything tightened up and the television standing up within a couple minutes.</p><p> Despite being a 43-inch class television, the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is light enough for most people to handle and set up without any outside assistance.</p><p> Once the feet are on, or the television has been hung on a wall mount, it’s time to turn it on. This presents you with the Fire TV interface, so you should be ready to pick your favorite apps, connect to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430" >Wi-Fi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or wired network, and then log into your Amazon account if you want to get the most out of your new television. There’s also a basic mode if you don’t have an Amazon account or just don’t want to log in.</p><p> The final part of the setup process involves waiting for your apps to download, and then allowing the Fire TV to download and install a firmware update. None of this is too terribly time consuming, but plan on setting aside at least 10 to 15 minutes before your TV is fully ready to watch.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crystal-clear-and-beautiful-colors-but-HDR-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crystal-clear-and-beautiful-colors-but-HDR-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crystal clear and beautiful colors, but HDR leaves a bit to be desired"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crystal clear and beautiful colors, but HDR leaves a bit to be desired</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is a 4K UHD television with HDR support, and the picture quality is a massive improvement over lower resolution (1080p, 720p) televisions, especially if you have hardware or media that’s capable of taking advantage of the increased resolution. Game consoles like the 4K-capable Xbox One X and PS4 Pro look great, as do UHD Blu-rays.</p><p> We also loaded up Amazon Prime Video, which includes a bunch of 4K content if you don’t have any UHD devices. Watching an episode of The Tick, Peter Serafinowicz’s bright blue suit popped against the comparatively drab cityscape, and the action was clear and crisp as he bounded from building to building.</p><p> Viewing angles on our test unit were great, with a bit of noticeable color or brightness variation when viewing from up close and at extreme angles.</p><p> Colors look great across all kinds of different content, but the contrast isn’t as good. Dark scenes seem a bit muddy, with areas that should be perfect black being lighter than they really should be.</p><p> While this set does have UHD support, it’s limited to HDR10 and doesn’t support local dimming. That means the HDR isn’t as effective as you’ll see in more expensive televisions, but it’s still great for a budget TV like this.</p><p> Viewing angles on our test unit were great, with a bit of noticeable color or brightness variation when viewing from up close and at extreme angles. When backed up to a more appropriate distance, we didn’t have any problem viewing this television from any seat in the house.</p><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Surprisingly-good-for-a-budget-set"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Surprisingly-good-for-a-budget-set" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Surprisingly good for a budget set"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Surprisingly good for a budget set</strong></h2><p> Built-in television speakers usually aren’t very good, which is why soundbars are popular. That’s especially true of budget television sets, but the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 actually has decent audio quality. You’ll probably want to invest in a soundbar if you don’t already have one, but the sound quality is good enough that you can get by with the built-in speakers if you need to.</p><p> When watching shows on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and HBO Now, dialogue came through crystal clear, and sound effects had enough substance that we didn’t feel the need to immediately plug in a soundbar or reach for our Bluetooth headphones. We also loaded up Amazon Music, turned the volume up, and found that the speakers were loud enough to fill the room without any noticeable distortion. The speakers are definitely lacking in bass, but it’s still surprisingly good for a budget television.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600113&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Win：Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OfRGDj7hZY6nrkoT_HqDEM1S9Ts=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-2-8b38ffeb5ce44c0d9a6c7aa7f6dce4cd.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=11224199&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/copy_boxshot_lyricvideo.png"                      border="0"                >Lyric Video Creator Professional Version</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Ports-Full-complement-of-digital-and-analog-inputs-and-outputs"><a href="#Ports-Full-complement-of-digital-and-analog-inputs-and-outputs" class="headerlink" title="Ports: Full complement of digital and analog inputs and outputs"></a><strong>Ports: Full complement of digital and analog inputs and outputs</strong></h2><p> The ports are split, with some on the left side of the television as you face it, and others exiting toward the bottom.</p><p> On the left side, you’ll find a headphone jack, USB port, and two HDMI ports. The first HDMI port is also ARC capable, which means you can use it to feed audio signals to a compatible soundbar without requiring a separate audio cable.</p><p> On the bottom, you’ll find an ethernet port, digital optical output, RCA jacks for analog video and audio inputs, a coaxial connector for your antenna or cable box, and a third HDMI port.</p><p> All of the ports are well clear of the VESA mount, so you shouldn’t lose access to them if you opt to mount the set on a wall. The exception is that if you use a flush mount, you’ll have trouble reaching the down-facing bank of ports due to the way that the chassis of the television bulges out at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/V97gOTfZ6Zys4aZv9gzGupbwRi8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-3-b8a8cb21803f40ada92bf08de6ee6fc0.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Built-in-Fire-TV-with-Alexa-voice-controls-is-snappy-and-responsive"><a href="#Software-Built-in-Fire-TV-with-Alexa-voice-controls-is-snappy-and-responsive" class="headerlink" title="Software: Built-in Fire TV with Alexa voice controls is snappy and responsive"></a><strong>Software: Built-in Fire TV with Alexa voice controls is snappy and responsive</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is the Fire TV edition of this hardware. It also comes in a slightly different configuration that’s built on the Roku platform instead, but this one has Fire TV baked in with no option to switch.</p><p> As a Fire TV, this television is excellent. It runs just as well as our Fire TV Cube, and the menus and apps load faster than they do on our Fire TV Sticks. If you primarily use your television for streaming through apps like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube, then you won’t have any problems with this television.</p><p> It runs just as well as our Fire TV Cube, and the menus and apps load faster than they do on our Fire TV Sticks.</p><p> We also tested out the Alexa voice command implementation and found that it works very well. Even with two other Alexa devices in earshot, including a Fire TV Cube, the Insignia’s voice remote picked up and executed our commands flawlessly.</p><p> If you watch a lot of broadcast television or have a cable box, the Fire TV interface can be a bit more frustrating. The main issue is that the Fire TV remote just isn’t built with regular television use in mind, as it lacks a numeric keypad.</p><p> You can ask Alexa to tune to specific channels, and the Fire TV interface has a section for over the air television channels, but the implementation is a little clumsy in its current incarnation.</p><h2 id="Price-Right-in-line-with-other-43-inch-class-smart-TVs"><a href="#Price-Right-in-line-with-other-43-inch-class-smart-TVs" class="headerlink" title="Price: Right in line with other 43-inch class smart TVs"></a><strong>Price: Right in line with other 43-inch class smart TVs</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 has an MSRP of $299.99, but it’s typically available for around $249.99. Priced at around $249.99, it’s right in the general neighborhood of other 43-inch class smart televisions, including other Fire TVs, sets built around Roku, and others with proprietary systems. There are a lot of decent options in the general $200 to $250 range, but this one is the best of the bunch if you’re firmly entrenched in Amazon’s ecosystem.</p><h2 id="Competition-Beats-out-other-Fire-TV-models"><a href="#Competition-Beats-out-other-Fire-TV-models" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Beats out other Fire TV models"></a><strong>Competition: Beats out other Fire TV models</strong></h2><p> Compared to previous 43-inch class televisions built on the Fire TV platform, the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is the clear winner. For example, the Toshiba 43LF421U19 is a 43-inch class set that’s also built on the Fire TV platform, and sells for about $299.99, but it’s worse than the Insignia in almost every category. It isn’t 4K or HDR-capable, the viewing angles are worse, colors aren’t as good, and the built-in Fire TV is sluggish compared to the Insignia unit that we tested.</p><p> Toshiba’s 43LF621U19 Fire TV Edition is a 4K UHD television that comes closer to matching the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19, with an MSRP of $329.99, a similar set of ports, and a basic mode that doesn’t require an Amazon account. It also has worse contrast and color range, so the Insignia is still our recommendation of the two.</p><p> If you aren’t specifically focused on Fire TV, the TCL 43S517 is a decent alternative to this set. It’s a 43-inch class smart TV that’s built on the Roku platform instead of Fire TV, and it works a bit better is a regular television, with cable and over the air broadcasts, than the Insignia. It also has ever so slightly better color reproduction. It does have a higher MSRP of $499, but it’s typically available for around $240 to $260.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>This is the budget Fire TV to own if you can’t step up to a larger model.</strong></p><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 isn’t perfect, but it’s probably as close as you’ll get at this price point. This is definitely the UHD TV to own in the 43-inch class if you’re deep in the Amazon ecosystem and really want to go with Fire TV as your smart TV platform. It has great color reproduction, excellent viewing angles, and even decent sound from the onboard stereo speakers.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  NS-43DF710NA19 43” 4K Fire TV</li><li>Product Brand  Insignia</li><li>UPC  600603233920</li><li>Price  $300.00</li><li>Release Date  September 2018</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.9 x 38.2 x 24.3 in.</li><li>Warranty  One year limited</li><li>Compatibility  Alexa, Fire TV</li><li>Platform  Fire TV</li><li>Screen Size  42.5 inches</li><li>Screen Resolution  2160p (4K)</li><li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)  Yes</li><li>Refresh Rate  60Hz</li><li>Maximum Contrast Ratio  4000:1</li><li>Ports  3x HDMI, USB, Digital Optical Audio Output, RCA Audio Output, Composite Video Input, RF Antenna Input, Headphone Jack, Ethernet</li><li>Speakers  Stereo 8-watt speakers</li><li>Connectivity Options  Wi-Fi, Ethernet</li><li>Mount Included  No</li><li>Stand Included  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/shooter-meets-saga-an-immersive-review-of-the-outer-worlds-sci-fi-fun-for-the-ages/"><u>'Shooter Meets Saga': An Immersive Review of 'The Outer Worlds' – Sci-Fi Fun for the Ages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-10-best-youtube-video-trimmers-online/"><u>[New] 10 Best YouTube Video Trimmers Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-ultimate-speaker-change-tech-for-internet-showbiz-pros/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Ultimate Speaker Change Tech for Internet Showbiz Pros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-beginners-glossary-for-instagram-chat-rooms-for-2024/"><u>[New] Beginner's Glossary for Instagram Chat Rooms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-exiting-facebook-livestreams-device-specific-methods-for-2024/"><u>[New] Exiting Facebook Livestreams  Device-Specific Methods for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-gaming-hits-with-powerful-hashtag-strategies-for-2024/"><u>[New] Gaming Hits with Powerful Hashtag Strategies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-through-a-headsets-lens-a-history-of-vr/"><u>[New] Through a Headset's Lens  A History of VR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-tutorial-for-turning-followers-into-cash-via-instagram/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Ultimate Tutorial for Turning Followers Into Cash via Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-leveraging-dual-screen-on-apple-devices-through-safari/"><u>2024 Approved  Leveraging Dual-Screen on Apple Devices Through Safari</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-mathematics-behind-making-money-from-snippets/"><u>2024 Approved  The Mathematics Behind Making Money From Snippets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/3-ways-for-android-pokemon-go-spoofing-on-itel-s23plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing On Itel S23+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/9-best-free-android-monitoring-apps-to-monitor-phone-remotely-for-your-xiaomi-civi-3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>9 Best Free Android Monitoring Apps to Monitor Phone Remotely For your Xiaomi Civi 3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/affordable-amazon-basics-antenna-guide-for-crystal-clear-free-television/"><u>Affordable Amazon Basics Antenna Guide for Crystal Clear Free Television.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/affordable-american-karaoke-fun-less-than-150/"><u>Affordable American Karaoke Fun -

No, it wasn’t the most powerful headset out there, using a two-year-old smartphone processor to power its games and experiences, but it was a capable, completely self-contained, wireless VR headset that didn’t require a PC or game console to deliver stellar immersion.</p><p> It was one of last year’s greatest new gadgets, and now Oculus has returned with a sequel. The Oculus Quest 2 is smaller and lighter, yet more powerful and with a much better screen—yet it costs $100 less than the original. How did that happen? Well, it’s not all great news, thanks to a couple of cost-cutting measures that you’ll feel and potentially see, but the end result is ultimately a better and more affordable device that serves as an ideal gateway into VR.</p><h2 id="Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made"><a href="#Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made" class="headerlink" title="Design and Comfort: Compromises were made"></a>Design and Comfort: Compromises were made</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 sticks to the familiar modern VR playbook as a module that you strap onto your face to immerse yourself within its digital worlds but features some different material and construction choices than the original. Unfortunately, the design choices largely are not upgrades compared to the original headset</p><p> Noticeably, the module itself doesn’t jut out as far from your face as before, plus it has a white plastic finish rather than the black fabric-lined exterior of the original. It also weighs less, which is a good thing for a device that hangs off of your face: it comes in at 503g compared to 571g with the original Quest.</p><p> However, the shallower depth of the module makes an impact for someone like me who must wear glasses while using the Quest 2.</p><p> Even with the included, optional glasses spacer, which adds a couple extra millimeters between the lenses and where the padded visor presses against your face, the inside felt much tighter against my glasses. It can be tricky to get the Quest 2 on without my eyelashes brushing against my lenses.</p><p> But that’s also due in part to the new fabric strap system, which is less effective than the rubber, dome-like strap from the first Quest. That previous strap did a better job of cupping the back of your head to offset the weight of the module itself and keep it comfortably strapped to your head, but these loose, adjustable fabric straps aren’t nearly as secure. It took me longer to get the headset on and in a comfortable position, and I couldn’t find the same kind of sweet spot as before.</p><p> Oculus now sells a $49 Elite Strap attachment that’s more akin to the original Quest strap, and while the Quest 2 straps are usable, I’ll probably make the upgrade and buy the better strap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JkgQv_Sk0ofSL0Sp-jKmqe84xak=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-2-a7792535288542dba45c8bc32f882be2.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Rift 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://cowinaudio.pxf.io/c/5597632/1116855/13794" target="_top" id="1116855"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13794-1116855"                      border="0" alt="" width="767" height="285"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1116855/13794"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks"><a href="#Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks"></a>Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 uses the same kind of “inside-out” tracking system that relies on four cameras on the visor to track the wireless controllers or even your hands, rather than relying on external tracking sensors as some PC-based systems do. Like the original, it works amazingly well, allowing for fluid, six-degrees-of-freedom movement in games and minimizing both initial setup and the time it takes to get going each session. It also means that you can use the Oculus Quest 2_anywhere_ without the need for any kind of external hardware or accessories.</p><p> The Quest 2’s wireless, motion-sensing Oculus Touch controllers are identical in function to the original, but are a little heavier and have a larger surface with space to rest your thumb when not in use. That’s handy. Each has an analog stick and two face buttons, along with a trigger button and a grip button. Oculus also swapped out the magnetically-attached battery doors from the first Quest controllers—which would sometimes slide open when I used the original—for ones that simply click into place. That’s a win for function over form.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1aG6kdNHMuvnim8p8_i1RwH9QG8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-3-eec6cabc11db4ed9be5254aa2bc46ec1.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 "                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> But there is a potential loss for function and comfort with one other particular aspect of the headset itself: IPD adjustment. Inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is the physical distance between your eyes, and a headset must account for it to effectively deliver clear, 3D experiences. On the original Quest, a physical slider let you precisely adjust the distance to match your own face. With the Quest 2, however, there are just three settings, and you can physically shift the placement of the lenses to choose the position that is closest to your own.</p><p> If your IPD matches or is very close to one of the settings (58mm, 63mm, 68mm), then you’re all set. If not, then you may notice that the image isn’t as clear as you’d like, and it could potentially lead to headaches if you can’t find a pretty good sweet spot. In my case, my IPD is close enough to the middle setting to be OK, but it doesn’t feel as spot-on as it did on the original Quest using the slider. It might help knock down the price of the headset, but that’s a quality-of-life downgrade that will affect some people significantly more than others.</p><p> That might sound like a lot of griping, but it’s only because some of the key physical design changes on the Quest 2 feel like compromises or downgrades. But for most people, they won’t be significant impediments. And if you’re coming to the new headset without ever using the original Quest, then you should be fine—the new straps are usable, but they aren’t as effective or effortlessly adjustable as before. Luckily, the Quest 2 makes significant strides elsewhere.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4727541&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/copy_copy_forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Gold Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gwWuuSfTzWNDoS45b-iG9qG32-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-4-27f169e7e71b4372a38e13332b7b1364.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook"></a>Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook</h2><p> You should charge the Oculus Quest 2 out of the box, as the modest total battery life means a partially-charged headset isn’t going to last very long. You will need a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , either Android or iPhone, and the free Oculus app to complete setup, as well. Once the headset has a good charge, begin setup from the mobile app and then follow the guided directions, which will involve putting on, adjusting, and getting familiar with the headset itself.</p><p> Part of the setup process, and the process each time you use the headset, is to designate your play space by “drawing” a barrier within the augmented view of your surroundings seen through the headset’s cameras. From there, the headset determines whether you have enough space for active, room-scale experiences, or you can choose a stationary setup for seated play modes. During active play, a virtual barrier called the Oculus Guardian appears when you get close to the edges of your designated play space to help you avoid crashing into your surroundings. It’s all rather clever and effective.</p><p> There’s one other potential hitch with the Oculus Quest 2 that wasn’t present with the original: the new headset_requires_ a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tutorial-how-facebook-works-2654610" >Facebook account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and there’s no way around it. Facebook owns Oculus, and while the first Quest could be used simply with an Oculus account, the new one requires the social media account. For some, that may be a deal-breaker, given frustrations over privacy and the increasing role that Facebook plays in our society, so just know that going in.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade"><a href="#Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It’s a big upgrade"></a>Performance: It’s a big upgrade</h2><p> The original Oculus Quest did a fine job of delivering immersive VR experiences that didn’t feel compromised or significantly downgraded, even if it didn’t hit the same visual peaks as pricier, PC-powered headsets. And it was pretty amazing that the Quest did so with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, a chip found in 2017’s flagship smartphones.</p><p> The Oculus Quest 2 takes things to another level, and there are a few reasons why.</p><p> First off, the new Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chip here is based on the current Snapdragon 865 chip seen in phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Note20, and is three generations newer than the old chip.</p><p> It’s also paired with 50 percent more RAM (6GB) than the original Quest. Even more vividly, the fast-switching LCD screen packs in nearly 50 percent more pixels per eye than the old OLED panels did, for a noticeably crisper and smoother experience.</p><p> On the first Quest, you got 1440x1600 resolution per eye: solid, but a bit fuzzy and comparatively lower resolution than some of the PC headsets on the market. Here, however, the single screen provides 1832x1920 per eye, and the difference is obvious. While the switch from OLED to LCD technology should weaken the contrast a bit and dampen the deep black levels, I’ll be honest: I didn’t notice.</p><p> What I did notice was sharper interfaces and smoother action, with more fluid-feeling experiences that exhibited fewer of the occasional-yet-tolerable hitches seen with some games and apps on the first Quest headset.</p><p> Additionally, Oculus recently enabled the Quest 2 to hit a peak 90Hz screen refresh rate, up from 72Hz on the first headset, which will only help deliver that smoother-feeling usage. Developers must enable 90Hz within their apps and games, however.</p><p> I felt the Quest 2’s enhancements more prominently in some games over others. Laser sword-swinging music game Beat Saber, for example, ran well on the first headset and isn’t that different here—just smoother and clearer-looking. But with the online battle royale shooter Population: One, the cleaner-looking textures and more fluid performance helped mitigate some of the light motion sickness I felt playing on the first Quest.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones"></a>Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones</h2><p> Plugging in headphones delivers a more closed-off, immersive experience, but the Oculus Quest 2’s built-in speaker does a solid job of delivering audio and music. It does sound a tiny bit louder and fuller than the original Quest’s speaker, but not significantly so. Still, if you want to play without being fully shut-off from your surroundings, it works just fine.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698827&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/dex3REpage-newmainscreenshot.png"                      border="0"                >DEX 3 RE is Easy-To-Use DJ Mixing Software for MAC and Windows Designed for Today’s Versatile DJ. </p><p> Mix from your own library of music, iTunes or use the Pulselocker subsciprtion service for in-app access to over 44 million songs.

For such a compact, standalone headset, I think that’s reasonable. You get a couple hours to play, and then you can take a breather and do other things while it charges.</p><p> That said, if you’re keen on longer-lasting experiences, Oculus sells a $129 version of the Elite Strap with a built-in battery pack that doubles the play time, or you can get a portable battery pack, plug it in, and stick it in your pocket during use. Lastly, you could just use a lengthy USB-C cable and plug yourself into a wall. If you’re doing room-scale VR games and apps with free movement, however, you’ll need something longer—like 10 feet or more. Otherwise, some seated apps and games will work just fine when you’re tethered to a nearby wall outlet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ns2S3DQVema5UEDDSO8n3N7SC_4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-7-0a0e40b6a3064fe7abc985f0900dbeff.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC"><a href="#Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC" class="headerlink" title="Software: Use the headset or connect to PC"></a>Software: Use the headset or connect to PC</h2><p> The headset’s own interface hasn’t changed much from the first Quest, taking place in a 3D home-like environment with floating menus that you can access via the motion controllers. It’s a pretty easy way to choose between your currently installed games and apps, install anything else in your library, purchase and download new content, and access video content including apps like Netflix, YouTube, and SlingTV.</p><p> Oculus has also enabled optional hand tracking, including the use of hand and finger gestures to get around the interface and interact with some games. Hand tracking is definitely more finicky than using the controllers, however, and you’ll need solid lighting to really rely on it. That said, it does still feel experimental, and I encountered enough misread gestures and incorrect interactions to make me want to stick to the controllers. They work reliably great.</p><p> Since the original Quest’s launch, Oculus added the ability to connect the headset to a powerful PC to run more advanced VR experiences, and that carries over to the Quest 2, as well. You’ll need a PC that is capable of running headsets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as either the official Oculus Link USB-C cable ($80) or a comparable USB 3.1 cable that can handle the high-speed demands. I bought an unofficial cable for half the price on Amazon, and it worked great.</p><p> Using a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, I was able to play the visually demanding and deeply immersive Half-Life: Alyx on the Oculus Quest 2—a game that it could never run using its own internal hardware. It ran a little less smoothly than it did using the PC-native Valve Index headset, but not significantly so. This is a great way to experience higher-end VR games, including the new<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/star-wars-squadrons-review-5086656" >Star Wars: Squadrons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , for example. And with Oculus announcing plans to phase out PC-only headsets, it will also be a key part of the Quest platform’s future.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/72vxixVr7kdKoLfUC3QkIrBl26I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-6-12fcb6054cf2475191bc613a3f26bcfc.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The $299 edition of the headset comes with 64GB of internal storage and the $399 version nets you 256GB, with some of each tally taken up by system software and resources. Luckily, the games and apps themselves aren’t huge, typically weighing in between 1-4GB apiece, sometimes less, and they’re pretty quick to download again if you want to revisit something. The 64GB edition should provide enough space for most players, as you could probably comfortably have a dozen or more games installed, along with streaming media apps, but anyone who wants to have a robust VR library on hand at all times without waiting might consider spending the extra cash.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><h3 id="200610"><a class="link"   href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/200610/3022" >Parental Control Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><span class="text-ad-content">    #1 Rated Parental Control Software.<br/>    Monitor & Control all PC Activity!<br/>        <cite style="color:green">sentrypc.com/parental-controls/</cite>    </span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/200610/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Games: A good, growing selection<p> Although those aforementioned games and some others are still only found on PC (or maybe PlayStation VR on the PlayStation 4 or 5), the Oculus Quest platform has amassed a very nice selection of native games that you can download and play right on the headset.There is no difference in compatibility between the headsets: all Quest games play on Quest 2 and vice versa, just with performance differences.</p><p> Many of the early games from the impressive Quest launch lineup are still among the best games you can play on the Quest 2. The aforementioned Beat Saber, which finds you swinging your controllers to slash faux lightsabers through soaring rhythmic beats, is a frenetic blast, now with a larger library of songs including BTS and Linkin Park packs. Superhot VR is a stylish hybrid of a shooter and a puzzle game, of sorts, as you figure out how to clear through foes while avoiding incoming bullets that only move when you do. Meanwhile, the Star Wars VR game Vader Immortal still does a great job of creating an authentic atmosphere.</p><p> But there’s so much more now, too. Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite, both from developer Enhance Games, are trippy, trancelike experiences that you can sit down and really savor in VR. Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners and the aforementioned Population: One show that larger-scale shooter experiences can be immersive and compelling in VR, plus there’s a newer Star Wars game, Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge, that blends interactive storytelling with fun blaster battles.</p><p> There’s a lot of great stuff on Quest 2, ranging from simple arcade-like experiences to larger-scale adventures, quirky interactive experiences, and more. And on top of that, there are the aforementioned video services for 360-degree videos, plus fitness apps and games, VR chat for communicating with friends and random people, a web browser, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FqVvo044zoPghSD_PR1g2e0L2rs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-5-216bbf638cbe407b8b6f332abc94ae47.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Price-It’s-an-amazing-value"><a href="#Price-It’s-an-amazing-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s an amazing value"></a>Price: It’s an amazing value</h2><p> The Oculus Quest was already impressively priced at $399, so launching the more powerful Oculus Quest 2 at $299 is pretty phenomenal. Granted, the design compromises are a little frustrating, and I would’ve rather paid more for a better strap and more precise IPD settings like on the original—but those are the tweaks made to try and broaden the market for the Quest and VR as a whole. Still, even with those design annoyances, the Quest 2 is an incredible value for a portable, fully self-contained VR game console.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TDsFPvRGkhZaFzIaNnKRk1_xO4s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-8-Comparison-1b0c51b029da41389167e103a4c4843a.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR"></a>Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR</h2><p> Amazingly, there is no direct analog to the Oculus Quest 2 on the market: Oculus seems to be the only company that can release such a powerful device at this kind of price and with this kind of software support. That said, if I had to compare it to another VR headset, I’d put it up against Sony’s PlayStation VR, which requires a PlayStation 4 or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> console.</p><p> The PSVR is a few years old now and is technically overshadowed by the Quest 2 in terms of screen and controller quality. Still, Sony has amassed some stellar exclusive games thanks to its partnerships with game developers, and the PlayStation VR is a solid, reasonably affordable pickup for anyone who already has a PS4 or PS5 console and wants to dabble in VR. But if you don’t already have the console, and you want to get into VR, go for the dedicated Quest 2 instead. It’ll be cheaper than buying a headset and console together, plus it’s a better VR experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-vr-review-4692684" >Sony PlayStation VR Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The best VR device, all things considered.</strong></p><p> The significant performance upgrade and surprising price drop outweigh some of the annoying design shifts with the Oculus Quest 2, making it the must-have VR headset for just about everyone. Not only does it play a great library of on-headset games, but it can also connect to a powerful PC to play even more games on top of that. Add to that the ease of use, quality gameplay, and immersive visuals, and the Oculus Quest 2 is another brilliant VR game console.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-rift-s-review-4764112" >Oculus Rift S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-go-vr-headset-review-4690298" >Oculus Go Standalone VR Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Quest 2</li><li>Product Brand  Meta</li><li>UPC  815820021292</li><li>Price  $299.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2020</li><li>Weight  1.1 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.54 x 5.61 x 4.02 in.</li><li>Color  Gray</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Android 10</li><li>Processor  Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2</li><li>RAM  6GB</li><li>Storage  64GB&#x2F;256GB</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-squaring-the-circle-of-facebook-engagement-with-visuals-for-2024/"><u>[New] Squaring the Circle of Facebook Engagement with Visuals for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-ion-air-pro-3-action-camera-review/"><u>[Updated] ION Air Pro 3 Action Camera Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-teleportation-and-time-warp-techniques-for-visual-effects/"><u>[Updated] Teleportation and Time Warp Techniques for Visual Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/bring-out-the-best-in-your-hp-laserjet-on-win11/"><u>Bring Out the Best in Your HP Laserjet on Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/doggy-drama-review-heartwarming-family-watch/"><u>Doggy Drama Review: Heartwarming Family Watch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/effortless-razer-mamba-driver-acquisition-process/"><u>Effortless Razer Mamba Driver Acquisition Process</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/elevate-your-game-with-philips-evonia-the-ultimate-gamers-49-inch-curved-monitor-experience/"><u>Elevate Your Game with Philips Evonia -

It’s 3.5” wide, 2.25” tall, 0.75” deep on the narrow side and 1” deep on the wide side. The right side of the camera, the one with all the controls, has a rounded bulge that grows from 0.75” to 1”, perfectly designed to fit the hand (the camera would otherwise have been too narrow to hold comfortably). There are several controls on the top of the camera—the on&#x2F;off button, the shutter, and the zoom controls.</p><p> On the reverse you’ll see several buttons, including play, menu, and video. There’s also a directional input that both navigates the menu and allows you to control the flash, self-timer, expose, and macro view. To access the SD card, you have to open the battery chamber, which means you can’t switch it out without turning off the camera. The Nikon COOLPIX A10 uses standard AA batteries, so you can use any old battery you buy at the store. When you turn the camera on the lens cover opens, and the lens extends from the camera out to a maximum of 2 inches. The camera weighs 5.7 ounces, just the right weight to feel sturdy but not so heavy that it’s awkward to use.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Scott Gercken</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Straightforward-and-simple"><a href="#Setup-Process-Straightforward-and-simple" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Straightforward and simple"></a><strong>Setup Process: Straightforward and simple</strong></h2><p> Like most point-and-shoot cameras, setup is simple. We just inserted the included AA batteries, put in the SD card (not included), and turned it on. The camera ran us through the standard steup (date, time, etc.) and then was ready to go.</p><p> Figuring out the controls was a different matter. There are a lot of buttons on the back of the camera, the most complicated of which is the “scene” button. Once you press it, a menu opens with a scene auto selector option, a series of scene options, selective color, smart portrait, and auto mode. There are 15 different scene modes including things like beach, portrait, night landscape, sports, and pet. We’ll talk about those a bit more in the section below.</p><p> The menu button takes you to the nuts and bolts of the camera, but it’s not complicated. The photo and video settings are simple and intuitive. You don’t really need to look at the rest of the settings, except date stamp and electronic vibration resistance (EVR). EVR is off by default, so if you have shaky hands, that’s the place to go.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Scott Gercken</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4694919&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

But the megapixel count doesn’t express much about the quality of the camera or the photographs it takes. We took the Nikon COOLPIX A10 out to see what it could do, taking photos in every setting we could think of, from night landscapes to indoor pet shots. The COOLPIX produces quality photos in most circumstances.</p><p> We were most impressed when it came to image stabilization and zoom. In one test, we gave the camera to our most shaky tester, and we had him take a photo at every zoom level, through both the optical and digital zoom range. Despite his shaky hands, the photographs came out crisp and beautiful.</p><p> The sheen of high quality images quickly fades when you’re staring at a warning indicator for long, static moments.</p><p> Nearly every camera can perform well in great light, but the real test is at night, so we also took some late night photos of the Chicago skyline using the A10’s “night landscape” scene mode. Our first couple of photos were crazy blurry until we stabilized it and got a nice evening scene. We took a couple sunset photos, too, both in auto and in “sunset mode.” Both modes did a good job capturing the scene, and “auto” focused on the foreground while “sunset” focused on the sun. We also liked the “pet” mode, which gave the option to shoot continuous photos, useful for trying to get a cat to perform. Beyond a few useful features, though, a lot of the settings were bloat, and many of them felt designed more as marketing bullet points than for their real world utility.</p><p> The core experience of taking a photo was also frustrating. If we tried to use the camera shortly after taking a photo, it brought up a warning message: “Please wait for the camera to finish recording,” creating a massive delay between shots. The Nikon COOLPIX A10 has lots of cool features, but they don’t help much if you’re waiting forever for the camera to finish recording. At first we thought it was standard<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-shutter-lag-time-492713" >shutter lag <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but the interim between photos belied that explanation.</p><p> The Nikon COOLPIX A10 isn’t just point-and-shoot, though. You can manually set both white balance and ISO from the menu section (though these options are only available in the menu if the camera is in auto mode and not scene mode). Manual white balance made a really big difference for indoor photos. The auto camera mode did a pretty good job, but the photos were still a bit yellow. Once we changed the white balance, the colors were much more accurate. ISO options are straightforward, ranging from 80 to 1600. The Nikon COOLPIX A10 also allows you to change<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/automatic-exposure-ae-493263" >exposure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> settings, ranging from -2.0 to 2.0 on ⅓ increments. It’s useful if the auto gets it wrong, but the camera usually did a good job with exposure.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Scott Gercken</p><h2 id="Video-Quality-Noisy-grainy-video-in-all-kinds-of-light"><a href="#Video-Quality-Noisy-grainy-video-in-all-kinds-of-light" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality: Noisy, grainy video in all kinds of light"></a><strong>Video Quality: Noisy, grainy video in all kinds of light</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/point-and-shoot-camera-4688891" >Video capabilities <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> seem almost like an afterthought for the Nikon COOLPIX A10. The camera allows lots of options and settings for photographs, whether you want to manage them manually or through a preset scene. There isn’t anything like that for video. The only options you have are in resolution: 720, 480, or 240. When recording, the screen also doesn’t show any stats or information like it does when you’re taking a photo. You can zoom in or out, but you don’t know whether it’s using optical or digital zoom.</p><p> We took video both indoors and outdoors, in shade and in the sun. Indoor video was very noisy, and it didn’t get much better when we went outside in great light. We took a comparison video with an old iPhone SE (12 MP camera), and the iPhone had drastically better video quality in all kinds of light. If quality video is important to you, this is not the camera for you.</p><h2 id="Software-Not-worth-mentioning"><a href="#Software-Not-worth-mentioning" class="headerlink" title="Software: Not worth mentioning"></a><strong>Software: Not worth mentioning</strong></h2><p> The Nikon COOLPIX A10 uses .jpg files for photographs and .avi for movies. While the easiest way to retrieve your photos is through the SD card, Nikon has its own software to pull both photos and videos off the camera, a suite called ViewNX-i which includes both photo software and video editing software as well. One problem: we couldn’t figure out how to install it on the Mac we tested. We downloaded the right files and followed the instructions (several times), but nothing happened.</p><p> While the Nikon COOLPIX A10 takes beautiful photos, the user experience ruins the camera.</p><p> Fortunately, the COOLPIX A10 works easily with other photo library software, so we didn’t have to rely on Nikon. You should note, however, that the COOLPIX A10 does not come with a USB cord, an annoying oversight. The Nikon COOLPIX A10 also has some basic editing features, but they aren’t worth using if you have a competent PC. You can apply a couple gimmicky filters, and you can crop photos, but why would you try to do any editing on this tiny screen when you could use your computer? It feels like a feature set that some marketing exec dreamed up so they could claim the COOLPIX is ready for Instagram.</p><h2 id="Price-Low-priced-camera-with-some-major-flaws"><a href="#Price-Low-priced-camera-with-some-major-flaws" class="headerlink" title="Price: Low-priced camera with some major flaws"></a><strong>Price: Low-priced camera with some major flaws</strong></h2><p> The Nikon COOLPIX A10 has a list price of $75, around the same price as many entry-level digital cameras. It takes decent photos, so you can grab some nice vacay pictures at the beach or camping without exposing expensive gear to the weather. Our only major hesitation is around the lengthy delay between taking photos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=174416&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.easygifanimator.net/images/gif-animator.png"                      border="0"                >Easy GIF Animator is a powerful animated GIF editor and the top tool for creating animated pictures, banners, buttons and GIF videos.

The iPhone 6s does have a 12 MP camera against the COOLPIX’s 16, but that really only matters if you’re looking to print large photos or need extremely high resolution images. Often, it takes better photos than the COOLPIX A10, and it’s video capabilities are much better.. It doesn’t, however, have the ISO, white balance, or exposure options that the Nikon COOLPIX A10 has, and comes with a slightly larger price tag. We saw prices between $100 and $250 depending on the options, but for that price you also get an iPhone and all the additional functionality that comes with it.</p><p><strong>Polaroid iS048:</strong> The polaroid iS048 is a barebones digital camera. While it doesn’t have nearly as many features as the Nikon, it’s half the price. It’s designed to be the durable outdoor camera you give to the kids and is waterproof to ten feet. For $40, the iS048 is a viable outdoor alternative to the COOLPIX A10.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Beautiful photos but a frustrating user experience.</strong></p><p> While the Nikon COOLPIX A10 takes beautiful photos, the user experience ruins the camera. It’s difficult to use and locks up for a few seconds after every photo. The sheen of high quality images quickly fades when you’re staring at a warning indicator for long, static moments. Other entry-level cameras perform much better.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Coolpix A10</li><li>Product Brand

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is a fairly barebones unpowered antenna that utilizes the same paper-thin rectangular design that can be found on some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market. This design comes with its share of pros (easy setup, not too much clutter) and cons (limited performance, can’t stand on its own).</p><p> Mohu might not be breaking new ground with this antenna, but it’s more than sufficient for most city dwellers and perhaps even a few buyers in the suburbs with a relatively unobstructed path to the broadcast source.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Basic-but-effective"><a href="#Design-Basic-but-effective" class="headerlink" title="Design: Basic but effective"></a><strong>Design: Basic but effective</strong></h2><p> You can find a dozen identical versions of this unpowered antenna by doing a quick search for TV antennas online, and not for no reason. It’s a very uncomplicated design, doesn’t take up too much space, and doesn’t have a lot of points of failure. The 9x11.5-inch rectangular antenna surface is thin, pliable, and features two small punch-holes towards the top which can be used to pin the antenna to an appropriate surface.</p><p> The matte surface is white on one side and black on the other, which could be useful for helping blend the device in with your surroundings. The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is neither the thickest or the thinnest version of this design that we’ve seen. Some are closer to paper thin and extremely flexible, and others were more rigid. If you need to be able to bend the antenna quite a bit to fit it where you need to, this might not be the right one for you.</p><h2 id="Setup-Dead-simple"><a href="#Setup-Dead-simple" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Dead simple"></a><strong>Setup: Dead simple</strong></h2><p> Setup of the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is as easy as it gets with antennas. Since there is no external power to connect, you only need to worry about connecting the included coaxial cable to the device and to your TV and using the included pins or adhesive tabs to affix the device to a surface. Ease of setup is one of the benefits of a non-amplified antenna such as the Mohu Leaf.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453720/17020" target="_top" id="1453720"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453720"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453720/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Acceptable-but-not-incredible"><a href="#Performance-Acceptable-but-not-incredible" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Acceptable but not incredible"></a><strong>Performance: Acceptable but not incredible</strong></h2><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna wasn’t the highest performing antenna that I tested, even among similar unpowered antennas. In my channel acquisition test, the Leaf picked up 56 channels on average across all the iterations performed.</p><p> My apartment is located within city limits and doesn’t provide too much of a challenge for antennas, but I was able to reliably get as many as 76 channels from other devices. Nonetheless, the Leaf still provided a clear picture of all the major network stations without any issue. The only channels that I couldn’t pick up with the Leaf were pretty obscure, such as an audio-only station from a Korean Christian church. I think I’ll be okay without that one.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3546200&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.binteko.com/sites/default/files/banner01_468x60a.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Fairly-limited"><a href="#Range-Fairly-limited" class="headerlink" title="Range: Fairly limited"></a><strong>Range: Fairly limited</strong></h2><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is rated, as its name implies, for up to 30 miles of range. This is about what I would expect from an unpowered antenna. This device is clearly designed for buyers who live within close proximity to their local TV broadcast source, and not for those further out into the suburbs and beyond.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Excellent-for-the-performance"><a href="#Price-Excellent-for-the-performance" class="headerlink" title="Price: Excellent for the performance"></a><strong>Price: Excellent for the performance</strong></h2><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna has a 90-day rolling average price of $29 on Amazon, which puts it on the more affordable end of the spectrum. The price definitely feels appropriate for the performance and feature set, but it’s not an all-out bargain.</p><p> Buyers probably wouldn’t be wise to spend more money unless they live a bit further from their signal source and have had trouble with similar antennas in the past. I think that for most people living in cities, the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna should be more than enough.</p><h2 id="Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Blade-TV-Antenna"><a href="#Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Blade-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna vs Mohu Blade TV Antenna"></a><strong>Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna vs Mohu Blade TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> Mohu also makes the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mohu-blade-tv-antenna-review-4843106" >Mohu Blade <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a powered antenna with a slightly more unique design for a minor premium of $40. This antenna managed to reliably acquire an average of 69 channels in my tests, a big leap from the performance of the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna. That having been said, the Blade does require a power source, and installation is slightly more cumbersome than that of the Leaf. If I wasn’t having any trouble getting the channels I watch with the Leaf, I probably wouldn’t upgrade to the Blade personally.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>No fuss, good value.</strong><br> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is a great entry point into the TV antenna space, providing a nice mix of performance and value in a dead-simple package that won’t burden buyers during setup. It might not be powerful enough to suit the needs of suburban users and beyond, but if you’re close enough to the signal source, it’s a nice option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

Sitting outside and watching TV with friends and family. While there are some workarounds for getting standard TVs to work outside and staying somewhat protected from the elements, the reality is if you want a long-term solution, your best bet is to get a TV<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-outdoor-tvs-4154865" >made specifically for the outdoors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Outdoor TVs like the Sealoc Coastal Silver are designed to take on the elements without batting an eye and provide a great viewing experience in nearly any environment you can throw their way. In this review, I share my experience with<a class="link"   href="https://www.sealoctvs.com/" >Sealoc’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> outdoor TV after spending more than 40 hours testing it over the course of two months throughout the ever-changing conditions of Michigan’s springtime.</p><h2 id="Design-Slim-and-sleek"><a href="#Design-Slim-and-sleek" class="headerlink" title="Design: Slim and sleek"></a><strong>Design: Slim and sleek</strong></h2><p> Unlike other outdoor TV manufacturers, Sealoc doesn’t simply form a box around a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >standard TV, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> seal a few areas and call it a day. No, instead they opt to strip down the TV as it is and quite literally waterproof it from the inside out, resulting in an ultra-thin outdoor TV that you’d barely recognize was weather-sealed.</p><p> The front of the television remains largely unchanged from the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >LG frame <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the TV is a modified version of. The bezels are thin and aside from protective seam tape around all sides of the television and a slim bead of clear sealant around the edge of the bezel to further protect it from the elements, it doesn’t look much different from the TV you probably have in your family room.</p><p> Compared to other outdoor TVs on the market, the Sealoc 55-inch Coastal Silver is slim and sleek, which not only creates a beautiful profile more akin to your average TV, but also makes for a much lighter piece of equipment.</p><p> Even on the back, there are only a few things that set it apart from your standard indoor TV. Most notably, the I&#x2F;O ports on the rear of the TV are covered by a water-resistant fabric that’s sealed at the top and secures to the back of the television on the three remaining sides via hook-and-loop tape that’s secured with additional screws. Sealoc has also modified the VESA mount on the rear of the TV, adding roughly two-inch lugs, which are sealed on the back of the television and help to provide extra distance from the wall the TV is mounted to.</p><p> Other smaller details you might notice include additional sealant on the upper vent of the television and a few extra strips of the seam tape around the various parts of the TV that could be entrance points for moisture.</p><p> Compared to other outdoor TVs on the market, the SkyVue Sealoc Coastal Silver is slim and sleek, which not only creates a beautiful profile more akin to your average TV, but also makes for a much lighter piece of equipment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8jle4bs6PXyy2Qzvq1c0IJW_V2E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Skyvue_55inch_OutdoorTV_1LW4154865_15_Horiz-f55f96dc584047a0b61f1e05f56976cc.jpg"                      alt="SkyVue 55-inch 4K Outdoor TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631722&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frontpage2-2048x588.webp"                      border="0"                >EmEditor Professional (Lifetime License, non-store app)</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Durability-It-can-handle-it-all"><a href="#Durability-It-can-handle-it-all" class="headerlink" title="Durability: It can handle it all"></a><strong>Durability: It can handle it all</strong></h2><p> The 55-inch Coastal Silver TV is part of Sealoc’s full exposure weatherproof series, which means it’s designed to take on nearly anything you can throw at it. As mentioned above, Sealoc doesn’t just slap a weatherproof case around the TV inside and call it a day. Instead, Sealoc strips down the TV and waterproofs even the internal electronic components using a proprietary “nano-coating” that helps to shed moisture away in the event it somehow manages to make it past the other sealing elements.</p><p> Around the entire perimeter of the TV Sealoc uses a heavy-duty seam tape that blends in perfectly with the frame of the television and anywhere the seam tape can’t be used, Sealoc uses a clear sealant, with the aforementioned protective flap used to keep the various ports and connections safe from water.</p><p> In the roughly two months I tested this TV, our home in Michigan saw snow, rain, and even dime-sized hail at one point. Through it all, the 55-inch Coastal Silver TV stayed put, mounted to an external wall on our fully-exposed patio. And through it all, not a single scratch or blemish was found on the television.</p><p> To really put it to the test, I also sprayed it with the hose on various settings for minutes at a time, and even on the Jet setting, the TV kept kicking with no signs of internal moisture anywhere.</p><p> Overall, unless you’re exposing this unit to salty seawater day in, day out, in the harshest environments, I have a hard time seeing how this TV won’t hold up for years to come.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GJ1StKRMx12EggdPfSJWCSSS7aY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Skyvue_55inch_OutdoorTV_1LW4154865_02_Horiz-1df71300a60d421f848d96050a856fbe-d93884cf38ee40188089dc6d114570d3.jpg"                      alt="SkyVue 55-inch 4K Outdoor TV"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4728277&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/1_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Not-much-to-it"><a href="#Setup-Process-Not-much-to-it" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Not much to it"></a><strong>Setup Process: Not much to it</strong></h2><p> Getting started with the 55-inch Coastal Silver TV is more or less plug and play. Since it doesn’t come with a stand, you will need some sort of wall mount (this particular model uses 400x400mm VESA mounting points). I suggest getting a great outdoor-specific mount to prevent unwanted rust, but if you’re planning on keeping it in a more covered area, you might be able to get away with a standard wall mount.</p><p> Once mounted and plugged in, it’s simply a matter of plugging in your peripherals and turning the TV on. On the topic of peripherals, it’s important to note that unless you’re using a compact stick-style device—such as a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/guide-to-chromecast-2438213" >Google Chromecast <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review-4691492" >Amazon Fire TV Stick <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —you’ll want to find a way to run cables to another weatherproof location, as there isn’t any room on the TV itself to mount or hide the devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OnY0-xZAailZsOzbKDqy1Zy3Gaw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Skyvue_55inch_OutdoorTV_1LW4154865_03_Horiz-65682943818f4cb49f1fe614eaeb18e6.jpg"                      alt="SkyVue 55-inch 4K Outdoor TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Image-and-Audio-Quality-Fantastic-rain-or-shine"><a href="#Image-and-Audio-Quality-Fantastic-rain-or-shine" class="headerlink" title="Image and Audio Quality: Fantastic, rain or shine"></a><strong>Image and Audio Quality: Fantastic, rain or shine</strong></h2><p> While this particular TV is branded as a full-sun Sealoc unit, underneath the branding and weather-sealing it’s an LG 6-series 4K HDR TV that’s been custom calibrated by Sealoc to offer specialized adjustments for optimized viewing in bright or direct-sun environments.</p><p> While this particular TV is branded as a full-sun Sealoc unit, underneath the branding and weather-sealing it’s an LG 6-series 4K HDR TV that’s been custom calibrated by Sealoc to offer specialized adjustments for optimized viewing in bright or direct-sun environments.</p><p> I tried to throw every scenario Mother Nature offered at the TV to see just how well the image held up and even in the brightest high-noon sun, the picture was great for watching TV shows or live sporting events. Dark and low-contrast scenes did prove the most affected by direct sunlight, but so long as you aren’t anticipating theater-quality dynamic range and color accuracy, the specially-calibrated picture modes proved great for getting a visible image that really makes the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of the TV shine.</p><p> Despite being entirely weather-sealed, the TV offers great sound quality. The midtones are clearly pushed up in the audio, but for most applications, particularly those where voices and commentary are more prominent, this didn’t prove to be an issue.</p><p> Despite being entirely weather-sealed, the TV offers great sound quality. The mid-tones are clearly pushed up in the audio, but for most applications, particularly those where voices and commentary are more prominent, this didn’t prove to be an issue. Now, if you’re hoping to hear every nuance of a movie’s soundtrack you might be disappointed, but if your environment is anything like mine, the stray humming of a lawnmower or leaf blower somewhere in the neighborhood will likely negate any high-quality analysis anyway.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5LTt3_JmSCZ2Cjd0ggeTdVK5pUc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Skyvue_55inch_OutdoorTV_1LW4154865_04_Horiz-f4876803f40845e7a399293e04b71906.jpg"                      alt="SkyVue 55-inch 4K Outdoor TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for"><a href="#Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for" class="headerlink" title="Price: You get what you pay for"></a><strong>Price: You get what you pay for</strong></h2><p> I’ll get straight to the point—this TV isn’t cheap. At $3,000, you could go through at least four of the standard LG 6-series units this model is based on. But not a single one of those would last through more than a single downpour.</p><p> This TV is priced at a premium because of the amount of work that’s gone into making it weatherproof and short of a tornado ripping the wall upon which it’s mounted to, this TV can handle it all. So, whether it’s mounted poolside for summer fun or on the viewing platform of your million-dollar yacht, you can count on getting fantastic image and audio quality in the most unlikely of environments.</p><p> Is it worth the premium? That’s up to you and your wallet, but there’s nothing else out there that can replicate the use case and quality this TV has to offer.</p><p> The Sealoc Coastal Silver TV is a niche product with a price to match.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713324&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVTV1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV TV Webcaster</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="55-inch-Sealoc-Coastal-vs-SunBrite-55-inch-Pro-Series"><a href="#55-inch-Sealoc-Coastal-vs-SunBrite-55-inch-Pro-Series" class="headerlink" title="55-inch Sealoc Coastal vs. SunBrite 55-inch Pro Series"></a><strong>55-inch Sealoc Coastal vs. SunBrite 55-inch Pro Series</strong></h2><p> While the 55-inch Sealock Coastal is somewhat in a league of its own, outdoor TV manufacturer SunBrite does offer a full-sun 55-inch TV as well. The 55-inch Pro Series (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SunBriteTV-Weatherproof-Outdoor-55-Inch-Television/dp/B07H45Y2LL/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5077335%7Cn322ca5b212d44e2293bc4c171617475d19%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is designed to be used in full sun like the Sealoc and offers up to 700-nit brightness as well as an anti-glare, impact-resistant screen.</p><p> However, the SunBrite 55-inch Pro Series TV comes in at $5,745, nearly double the cost of the Sealoc TV and doesn’t even feature 4K resolution, let alone HDR compatibility or the webOS smart TV interface. While SunBrite has been an established brand, it’s clear Sealoc wins in both the value and specification department.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-48-inch-tvs-4138374" >Hisense 50H8F Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A well-built 55-inch outdoor TV that can handle the elements.</strong></p><p> The 55-inch Sealoc Coastal Silver Outdoor TV is a niche product with a price to match. If you can spare the change, you won’t find a better option out there, as the TV offers a sleek design, fantastic visual&#x2F;audio quality, and a fantastic operating system to top it all off.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Outdoor TV Full Weatherized 55” UHD Smart Weatherproof LED Television</li><li>Product Brand  Sealoc</li><li>UPC  SB-V-55-4KHDR-BL</li><li>Price  $3,189.00</li><li>Weight  31 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  48.8 x 3.5 x 28.7 in.</li><li>Screen Size  55-inch</li><li>Screen Resolution  3840 x 2160 UHD</li><li>Aspect Ratio  16:9</li><li>Ports  3 HDMI, 2 USB Type-A</li><li>Formats  HD, 4K UHD, HDR</li><li>Platform  webOS</li><li>Speakers  20-watt (10W x2)</li><li>Connectivity Options  Wi-Fi, Ethernet</li><li>Warranty  One Year Limited Warranty</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/024-approved-dive-deep-into-duality-mastering-multi-video-watching-on-youtube/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Dive Deep Into Duality  Mastering Multi-Video Watching on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-simplifying-macs-screen-recording-a-shortcut-hack-manual-for-2024/"><u>[New] Simplifying Mac's Screen Recording  A Shortcut Hack Manual for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-comprehensive-guide-to-adding-srt-track-to-mp4-media/"><u>[Updated] Comprehensive Guide to Adding SRT Track to MP4 Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/2024-approved-advanced-editing-for-professional-photographers-time-stamping-tactics/"><u>2024 Approved  Advanced Editing for Professional Photographers  Time-Stamping Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/5-star-titles-in-hydro-dynamics-gaming-world-for-2024/"><u>5-Star Titles in Hydro Dynamics Gaming World for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-print-preparation-in-photoshop/"><u>A Comprehensive Guide to Print Preparation in Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/a-thrilling-sci-fi-shooter-experience-with-an-engaging-narrative/"><u>A Thrilling Sci-Fi Shooter Experience with an Engaging Narrative</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/advanced-sound-sanitation-on-windows-identifying-top-audio-noise-filtration-software/"><u>Advanced Sound Sanitation on Windows Identifying Top Audio Noise Filtration Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/affordable-luxury-unveiling-the-new-amazon-kindle-2019-for-savvy-readers/"><u>Affordable Luxury: Unveiling the New Amazon Kindle (2019) for Savvy Readers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/an-anorexia-nervosa/"><u>AN = Anorexia Nervosa;</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/an-in-depth-look-at-organic-light-emitting-diode-oled-functionality/"><u>An In-Depth Look at Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-undelete-lost-messages-from-lava-yuva-3-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/"><u>Best Android Data Recovery - Undelete Lost Messages from Lava Yuva 3</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/best-iphones-for-mobile-gaming-expert-recommendations/"><u>Best iPhones for Mobile Gaming - Expert Recommendations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/busting-wi-fi-dead-zones-a-look-at-the-amplifi-hd-smart-mesh-solution/"><u>Busting Wi-Fi Dead Zones: A Look at the Amplifi HD Smart Mesh Solution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/cat-s4-reviewed-robust-defense-versus-restricted-rapidity-in-rugged-telephones/"><u>CAT S4^_ Reviewed: Robust Defense versus Restricted Rapidity in Rugged Telephones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-and-comparison-for-every-ipad-version/"><u>Comprehensive Review & Comparison for Every iPad Version</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-unveiling-the-powerhouse-features-of-the-razer-blade-stealth-13-ultrabook/"><u>Comprehensive Review: Unveiling the Powerhouse Features of the Razer Blade Stealth 13 Ultrabook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/console-clash-evaluating-the-features-of-nintendo-switch-lite-vs-oled-display/"><u>Console Clash: Evaluating the Features of Nintendo Switch Lite Vs.
