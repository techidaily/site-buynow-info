Yakuza: Like a Dragon takes the standard Yakuza formula and stands it on its head, moving the fighting system from real-time to turn-based and making this entry to the series feel like a true JRPG. I played Yakuza: Like a Dragon<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-pc-games-4147292" >on PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find out if these changes make this game better or worse. Should you play the new Yakuza or skip it? Read on to check out my full review of Yakuza: Like a Dragon.</p><h2 id="Setting-and-Plot-A-very-long-intro"><a href="#Setting-and-Plot-A-very-long-intro" class="headerlink" title="Setting and Plot: A very long intro"></a>Setting and Plot: A very long intro</h2><p> Yakuza: Like a Dragon places you in the shoes of Ichiban Kasuga, a young Yakuza upstart who was raised as an orphan in a Soap House by the owner and the women who worked there. Kasuga gets into a bit of trouble with a Yakuza family but is saved by Masumi Arakawa, the patriarch of the Arakawa family. Because of this, Kasuga pledges his life to Arakawa, promising to repay the debt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Mo4mMH944CddmYJTyCxtMRxK9-k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_05-e59c99ba9bd249e7a2241f532dd742dc.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> A few years later, Kasuga is asked to confess to a murder that was really committed by one of the Captains in the family. Kasuga spends 18 years in prison for the crime, which brings us to modern day. Once out of prison, Kasuga finds he no longer has a place in the family due to some serious changes that have taken place while he was away. Kasuga is shot and left for dead in the Yokohama area of Isezaki Ijincho. From there, the game opens up as you try to rebuild everything that was lost and find out what happened.</p><p> All of the aforementioned story takes place in what could be called the introductory stages of the game. The intro was incredibly slow and took around five to six hours. Finally, after the long intro, it felt like I was getting into the real meat where the world opens up. Even after the long preamble, I was still introduced to new items, concepts, and parts of the game. It felt like a lot of handholding, which was frustrating at times.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_ksFqEWrm3B3MbfrBujuNtLpcXw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_03-37ca82f2a4cd42c4ad65f34e2ca63b68.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> Once things open up, the story gets going in what can only be described as a true modern-day JRPG. It has many of the common tropes of a JRPG, like a party system that allows you to manage those who fight with you, turn-based combat, and a long sweeping epic filled with plenty of side quests.</p><p> Overall, the story is interesting and engaging, with excellent voice acting, and deep and interesting characters.</p><p> Yakuza: Like a Dragon is clearly inspired by games like Dragon Quest. So much so that eventually, and in a truly hilarious fashion, Kasuga begins having delusions of being a hero, and makes it his life’s mission to become a hero who can save everyone around him. These delusions play out in a physical change that takes place over enemies during combat. Their eyes turn red, and their bodies change, but Kasuga is the only one who can see these changes.</p><p> Overall, the story is interesting and engaging, with excellent voice acting and deep and interesting characters. There are plenty of opportunities to get to know the people who travel with you, and you come to care about the characters and their motivations. Yakuza: Like a Dragon is story-rich, and you won’t be disappointed at the amount of content to explore.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Fun-yet-slow-paced-at-times"><a href="#Gameplay-Fun-yet-slow-paced-at-times" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Fun, yet slow-paced at times"></a>Gameplay: Fun, yet slow-paced at times</h2><p> Gameplay in Yakuza: Like a Dragon feels incredibly polished. World exploration feels intuitive—you can run from point to point, stopping for distractions along the way, and sometimes engage in a conversation with your party during travel. Yokohama feels alive and real. There are billboards, stores, and people everywhere. You have to be careful when crossing the street, as you can suddenly get hit by a car, which seems to happen more than it should.</p><p> The map is easy to use, and there is a taxi fast-travel system. As you explore, you will find some areas off-limits, but you’ll also find some areas where your level is not high enough to access. For the most part, though, running into enemies is really fun since it throws you into combat.</p><p> The game provides you with a ton of options in the fight, and many of the moves are both over the top and quite funny.</p><p> Combat is handled with a turn-based system. During the fight, you have a menu of different selections, from regular attacks and items to defending and special attacks. This is where Yakuza: Like a Dragon really shines. The game provides you with a ton of options in the fight, and many of the moves are both over the top and quite funny. For instance, you can have a homeless teammate attack with a flock of pigeons, or maybe have your bartender attack with moves from her boxing fitness class.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296740&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/biu/Nero_BackItUp_Screen_2.webp"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZvcwNcecc79umImvw53CUJlLvIc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_02-6396bcd8866c4a479331a02e160eb890.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> The moves are creative and fun to use. After selecting the attack, timed button presses may increase the attack’s effectiveness or provide you with bonus damage. When you need a true power attack, you can use your phone to call PoundMates, which is a special “Summoning” move that calls in an ally to do massive damage. There are tons of PoundMates in the game, from a diaper-wearing adult man to a poisonous lobster named Nancy, and calling these special attacks is part of what makes Yakuza fun to play.</p><p> You should be able to finish the main story in around 45 to 55 hours, depending on how fast you run through it, but I highly recommend taking your time and enjoying all the wonderful diversions available.</p><p> There’s a job system, which will let you change the different abilities of your team. This lets you customize your party to fill different roles, like healer or tank. However, in Yakuza, you’ll find some rather interesting jobs. There’s gear as well, but this is pretty standard fare. You’ll encounter a ton of diversions and side quests. Some of the minigames are innovative and comical, but some are also very benign.</p><p> This<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/pc-gaming-reviews-4689600" >PC game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> plays just like it should, and the controls are top-notch. Everything just works, which is a rare feat these days. You should be able to finish the main story in around 45 to 55 hours, depending on how fast you run through it, but I highly recommend taking your time and enjoying all the wonderful diversions available.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Excellent-visuals"><a href="#Graphics-Excellent-visuals" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Excellent visuals"></a>Graphics: Excellent visuals</h2><p> The graphics and visuals are impressive. Details are accurate and in the right places. Food looks so realistic (and delicious), and there were some moments where I could even see the pores on a person’s skin during cinematics.</p><p> During combat, there are graphical flourishes to keep the eyes excited, including damage feedback and hit animations. The city looks amazing, with realistic billboards and action.</p><p> During combat, there are graphical flourishes to keep the eyes excited, including damage feedback and hit animations.</p><p> The game ran at a smooth 60fps (I played at<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-the-term-1080p-means-1846837" >1080p resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), and rarely did I come across any graphical issues or bugs. The whole game has a very modern feel but also has so many nods to its JRPG roots. Things are both rooted in reality while also being completely over the top at times.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zrV5S3jL3_76G0PVgT1K_Ty6WWI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_04-e33b82262b344fecae27d668b3c92ba9-55ba8acb6d324eed81fbf5453e770db8.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Price-The-typical-60"><a href="#Price-The-typical-60" class="headerlink" title="Price: The typical $60"></a>Price: The typical $60</h2><p> The base version of Yakuza: Like a Dragon comes in at $60 like most new titles. The price is reasonable for the amount of gameplay. However, you have two other purchase options as well. The Hero Edition, which costs $70, includes the Job Set and the Management Mode set and features two extra jobs and three sets of Management mode employees.</p><p> The Legendary Hero edition costs $90, and it includes both previously listed sets, as well as the Crafting Mat, Stat Boost, Karaoke, and Ultimate Costume sets. These are all nice bonuses and can certainly add to the experience, but you will also find more than enough gameplay in the base game.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Yakuza-Like-a-Dragon-vs-Dragon-Quest-Series"><a href="#Yakuza-Like-a-Dragon-vs-Dragon-Quest-Series" class="headerlink" title="Yakuza: Like a Dragon vs. Dragon Quest Series"></a>Yakuza: Like a Dragon vs. Dragon Quest Series</h2><p> It’s clear Yakuza: Like a Dragon draws some inspiration from the recent Dragon Quest, Dragon Quest XI. Both games feature turn-based combat, jobs working as roles, and a large sweeping and epic tale. Yakuza: Like a Dragon diverges in one major way, and that is not being afraid to innovate and push the limits of what a JRPG can be.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Most<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wifi-extenders-4043312" >Wi-Fi extenders <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are reasonably affordable devices that are pretty easy, straightforward ways to improve your existing home Wi-Fi situation. Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender takes on a different kind of philosophy. That’s reflected in the boosted price, certainly, but also the capabilities: this is the first Wi-Fi 6 extender on the market.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a new standard that not only allows for faster maximum speeds than previous generations but also better accommodates the increasing pile of wireless devices that we have around our homes and connecting at any given time—from phones to laptops and smart home gadgets. Newer smartphones and laptops are implementing support for the standard, and new Wi-Fi routers are being released to supply those benefits.</p><p> If you don’t already have one of those new Wi-Fi 6 routers, should you spend extra for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 to futureproof your setup? Here’s what I think after testing the device for several days across everyday web usage, media streaming, playing online games, and more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Pretty-awkward"><a href="#Design-Pretty-awkward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Pretty awkward"></a><strong>Design: Pretty awkward</strong></h2><p> The Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is not only the largest and heaviest Wi-Fi extender I’ve tested at 10 inches tall and nearly two pounds, but it’s also one of the oddest-looking. It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward. Also, the little plastic feet don’t do a great job of supporting the weight, making it a bit wobbly on a flat surface.</p><p> With very large sides, the front is really just a small panel with light-up LED indicators showing connectivity details and which Ethernet ports are in use. There’s also a small WPS button beneath the LED panel for easy connectivity with a router. On the wider back panel are the four wired<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for plugging in devices such as game consoles and computers, as well as a USB 3.0 port, DC power port, and the power button itself.</p><p> It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app"><a href="#Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Avoid the app"></a><strong>Setup Process: Avoid the app</strong></h2><p> The setup options for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 are the same as with Netgear’s other extenders—even those without Wi-Fi 6 support. You’ll begin with the extender plugged in near your router. If your router supports<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wps-4842308" >WPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , then you can pair the extender with it easily by following the process listed in the included booklet, which is as simple as pressing a button on the router and then doing the same on the extender.</p><p> If that’s not an option, or you’d rather follow a step-by-step process with prompts, then you can set it up using either a mobile (iOS or Android) app or a web browser on your computer.</p><p> The mobile app has been unreliable in my experience with other Netgear extenders, but it was much worse when setting up the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The app repeatedly could not connect with the created mesh network on the extender during setup, and I had to factory reset the device multiple times to start again.</p><p> Over and over, the setup process wouldn’t complete… and then it finally did. I ran into similar issues with the other Netgear extenders, in which setup processes didn’t work as expected on the first or second time, but this was a much longer and more arduous ordeal. Finally, however, I got the Nighthawk AX8 up and running. From there, you’ll need to find a new location for the extender—roughly halfway between the router and your Wi-Fi dead zone is ideal, but play around with positioning if you’re not getting the results you seek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xru8JLL_UOk3sXBYpbrOyAl-ihc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_02-b120eab8816746338c53e4eb1cfc62d6.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Smooth-sailing"><a href="#Connectivity-Smooth-sailing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Smooth sailing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Smooth sailing</strong></h2><p> Once through the hassle of setup, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender really did deliver strong performance. I tested the connection in my office, which reliably sees reduced 5GHz reception from my router due to obstructions in between, and saw a noticeable boost in both reception and speed.</p><p> In one test, I registered a 5GHz speed of 246Mbps with the extender, which was the fastest wireless speed I’ve seen anywhere in my house using that older, TP-Link router. Given that, I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The router isn’t Wi-Fi 6 compatible, but I still saw higher top-end speeds than ever before.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender also performed pretty well in distance testing. In another instance, I registered a 5GHz download speed of 87Mbps with my office, and then measured the speeds from my backyard at approximate distance intervals from the extender.</p><p> I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8.</p><p> That 5GHz signal dropped down to 77Mbps at 25 feet, 74Mbps at 50 feet, and 56Mbps at 25 feet—still pretty speedy from the farthest edge of my property. Meanwhile, the 2.4GHz signal started at just 42Mbps at that moment in my office, and dropped to 30Mbps at 25 feet, 28Mbps at 50 feet, and 26Mbps at 75 feet.</p><p> Given the high max speeds, it wasn’t surprising to see strong gaming performance, as well. While playing Rocket League, I saw smooth gameplay across the wired Ethernet connection as well as both wireless networks, with a ping as low as 33 via the wired connection. The wireless ping was only a few points higher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rtnI3hSe9qP5qFqjhu1LRxe7qYY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_03-19da5fea4d0349ce984f52a11493d337.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> As a Wi-Fi mesh extender, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 will automatically replicate the SSID of your router’s existing Wi-Fi networks and seamlessly keep you connected whenever you’re in range of either. That’s true even with non-Netgear routers and those without Wi-Fi 6 support, and it’s a huge benefit over some cheaper extenders that don’t keep the same network info intact across devices.</p><p> It’s billed as an “8-stream” device, so it should be able to handle several simultaneous media streams at once, with a billed max speed of 4.8Gbps on the 5GHz band and 1.2Gbps on the 2.4GHz band.

The Nighthawk X6S (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Wi-Fi-Range-Extender-EX8000/dp/B074F3M2W8/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846125%7Cn35b11b2c61b54fa1a2d951691d1a61ed04%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) doesn’t have that, but it does deliver excellent 5GHz range and has four Gigabit Ethernet ports for wired devices. The Nighthawk AX8 is more future-proof as a result, but at a greater cost that becomes increasingly difficult to justify the higher, it climbs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Only for early adopters with Wi-Fi 6 routers and devices.</strong></p><p> If you’ve already bought a Wi-Fi 6 router and need a little help extending your signal into further corners of your home and&#x2F;or property, then the Nighthawk AX 8 (EAX 80) is the extender you’ll want. But if you don’t have a Wi-Fi 6 router, then you’ll either want to start there or consider investing in a Wi-Fi<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178" >mesh system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead. Spending more than $200 on an extender doesn’t make much sense unless you’re adding it to a top-of-the-line system—and don’t mind the significant investment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36506229&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><video width="100%" height="" class="rounded-t-md shadow-lg relative z-20" controls="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" webkit-playinginline=""></p><source type="video/mp4" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.mp4"><source type="video/webm" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.webm"></video></a><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Specs<ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk EAX80 AX6000 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>SKU  EAX80</li><li>Price  $249.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  10 x 7.75 x 4.2 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Ports  4x Ethernet, 1x USB</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Read on for our full take.</em></p><p> Nvidia’s RTX 30 series is the hottest thing in PC gaming right now. So hot, in fact, that it’s almost impossible to buy a desktop RTX 30 series graphics card, and even laptops with the hardware are flying off store shelves.</p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is, in many respects, a mid-range gaming laptop, but it succeeds at one very important task: it delivers Nvidia RTX 3060 Max-Q at a reasonable price, and it’s actually in stock not just at, but sometimes below, MSRP. Its value pricing helps the Triton 300 SE stand out against attractive competitors like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.</p><h2 id="Design-Small-but-sturdy"><a href="#Design-Small-but-sturdy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small but sturdy"></a>Design: Small but sturdy</h2><p> I’m surprised Acer didn’t slap a “Pro” label on the Predator Triton 300 SE. The spec sheet might scream gaming, but the laptop’s look and feel has more in common with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >business laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The aluminum exterior and simple silver interior keep this laptop subtle. It’s a bit dull, actually, compared to the sleek elegance of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-book-13-review-5176895" >Razer’s Book 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the brash look of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The Triton 300 SE measures 0.7 inches thick and weighs a hair less than 3.5 pounds. These figures aren’t unusual in 2021 but are impressive for a laptop packing serious gaming horsepower. It will easily fit in most backpacks or messenger bags, yet packs performance to rival modern game consoles.</p><p> It’s a sturdy little beast, too. The chassis feels slate-like in hand. Holding the laptop up by one corner reveals nearly no flex. The display is the weak point; opening the laptops can cause a few creaks and groans.</p><p> Physical connectivity is a mix of new and old. There are two USB-A 3.2 ports paired with a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port that supports DisplayPort Mode and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713" >Thunderbolt 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Smith</p><p> All the laptop’s ports are placed near the front of the chassis. You’ll have to deal with tangled cables more often than with a laptop that places most ports on the rear. I found this annoying when using an external mouse, as cables jutting from the laptop’s flanks often bumped my hand while playing games.</p><h2 id="What’s-New-This-one-is-special"><a href="#What’s-New-This-one-is-special" class="headerlink" title="What’s New: This one is special"></a>What’s New: This one is special</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE has little in common with other Predator Triton or Helios models. A few common design elements can be found in the speaker grill, fans, and PreadtorSense software, but the design is otherwise distinct.</p><h2 id="Display-Better-than-first-glance"><a href="#Display-Better-than-first-glance" class="headerlink" title="Display: Better than first glance"></a>Display: Better than first glance</h2><p> I wasn’t immediately impressed by the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s display. It’s not especially bright and has a matte coating, so lacks the brilliant, eye-catching look that is common to high-end laptops with glossy, high-brightness displays.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop. I noticed this in every game I played.</p><p> Once I loaded a game, though, I liked what I saw. The screen’s resolution is 1080p, but that’s more than enough to provide a sharp, crisp look in modern games. It also supports a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-refresh-rate-2625984" >maximum refresh rate of 144Hz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , providing an ultra-smooth look in older titles capable of achieving a high framerate.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop. I noticed this in every game I played. Games with bright, high-color graphics look vivid, while those with a moody tone look dark and foreboding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eRv5Q4rKutM9zrhSTCRxbBO4rVc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-6-2af7f9999ae847bda4f5b9b830c9c555.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> There’s one downside: poor viewing angles. This is unusual in a modern laptop, though I’ve noticed this trait in many high-refresh laptop displays. I can’t give the Triton 300 SE too much flak for this given its otherwise excellent performance.</p><h2 id="Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else"><a href="#Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else"></a>Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s most unusual feature is its Intel Core i7-11375H processor. It’s odd because it has just four cores (running eight threads) but is still sold as a top-tier component. The Core i7-11375H has higher minimum and maximum clock speeds than the comparable Intel Core i7-1165G7 found in thinner notebooks. The i7-11375H can clock as high as 5GHz. My review unit also had 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid-state hard drive.</p><p> PCMark 10 hit an overall score of 5,534. Geekbench 5 turned in a single-core score of 1,418 and a multi-core score of 4,493.

It also averaged 74 frames per second in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at high detail with ray-traced shadows off.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ray-tracing-5097484" >Turning ray-traced shadows on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reduced the average to 56 frames per second.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution.</p><p> These numbers may seem disappointing if compared to all RTX 3060 laptops. You can expect more from Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 and the Razer Blade 15. But don’t forget the price. Acer’s laptop significantly undercuts those alternatives. When compared to all gaming laptops, this Acer delivers great performance for the price.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution. I wouldn’t recommend the Triton 300 SE if you plan to use an external 1440p or 4K monitor, however. Pushing a higher pixel count will lead to sub-60fps performance in most demanding games.</p><h2 id="Productivity-All-business"><a href="#Productivity-All-business" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: All business"></a>Productivity: All business</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s business-like design carries over to the keyboard and mouse. Key feel is good, with significant key travel and firm bottoming action, and the spacious layout will be comfortable for most users.</p><p> There is a flaw: some keys are smaller than they could be. The Control, Function, and Windows keys are noticeable examples. It’s an odd decision that can cause confusion when hunting for a keyboard shortcut.</p><p> Keyboard backlighting is standard and set to white by default, but the color can be customized across three zones. It’s not as impressive as the per-key RGB backlighting found on some gaming laptops but I’m happy to see some customization offered.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4693127&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videosoftdev.com/images/video_editor/screenshots/1.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>VSDC Pro Video Editor is a light professional non-linear video editing suite for creating a movie of any complexity.

It has an upwards-facing speaker that provides clear, crisp sound in games, music, or podcasts.</p><p> There are limits, of course. It isn’t loud enough to project impressive volume in a living room or kitchen. It can also sound muddy and confused when playing bass-forward music or the most frantic action games. Still, it’s an impressive set of speakers that will rarely leave you wanting for more.</p><h2 id="Network-Killer-performance"><a href="#Network-Killer-performance" class="headerlink" title="Network: Killer performance"></a>Network: Killer performance</h2><p> Downloading a big, hot new game can be a real hassle, especially over Wi-Fi, but the Triton 300 SE can help.

I created a real-world stress test by downloading Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam while simultaneously downloading Metro Exodus on Epic. Surprisingly, both downloads averaged in excess of 25Mbps.

It’s a tiny 720p pinhole camera that squeezes between the display and the top bezel. Video quality is grainy in all but the brightest rooms and uneven lighting can easily confuse it.</p><h2 id="Battery-Ouch"><a href="#Battery-Ouch" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Ouch"></a>Battery: Ouch</h2><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story. This is a powerful laptop yet, due to its size, it contains a modest 60 watt-hour battery. That would be fine in a laptop without discrete graphics, but this is a gaming laptop.</p><p> I didn’t expect much endurance and received even less. My first effort at using the Triton 300 SE for a workday of writing had me reaching for the power brick after 3 hours. Two further workdays put me at about 3 hours, 30 minutes each.</p><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story.</p><p> In fairness to Acer, there’s little it could do to fix this issue. A slim gaming laptop sucks down a lot of juice even outside of games, yet there’s not much room for a battery. The majority of gaming laptops I’ve tested in recent years have delivered less than 4 hours of real-world endurance, and the worst won’t last 2 hours.</p><p> Still, buyer beware. The Triton 300 SE might look like a productivity laptop, but its battery life is solidly in the realm of full-blown gaming machines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RSfl2dEVmErlvh3BUUFcxqsbt9w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-2-c5eed4bfe7e44014952b5503566097d9.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S.

It includes a few touches exclusive to Acer, including a Planet9 wallpaper and a few other icons under the same.</p><p> Despite this, most laptop functions are controlled through the PredatorSense software interface. It can control fan modes, adjust keyboard lighting, and monitor temperatures, among other functions. PredatorSense is not much to look at, but I find it less confusing than the alternatives from Asus and Razer.</p><p> The laptop comes with Norton antivirus installed. It’s eager to remind you of its presence whenever you download a file or visit an unfamiliar website. The antivirus is easy to uninstall, but its presence takes away from what otherwise feels like a special laptop in Acer’s Predator line.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-An-outstanding-value"><a href="#Price-An-outstanding-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: An outstanding value"></a>Price: An outstanding value</h2><p> Acer sells the Predator Triton 300 SE for $1,400, and it sometimes sells for $1,350 at Best Buy. This is an outstanding price for a laptop packing Nvidia’s RTX 3060. There’s only a few competitors with the RTX 3060, such as MSI’s GF65 Thin, that can be purchased for less right now. The MSI GF65 manages to undercut the Triton 300 SE by using an older Intel chip and just 8GB of RAM.</p><h2 id="Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14"><a href="#Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14" class="headerlink" title="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14"></a>Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE and Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 seem to target the same users. They’re both compact, light 14-inch laptops that pack impressive CPU and GPU horsepower. Although great for gamers, they also appeal to content creators seeking an affordable, portable laptop.</p><p> The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 wins out in design and build quality. It’s an attractive, eye-catching laptop that feels more solid than the already respectable Triton 300 SE. The two laptops trade blows in display, keyboard, touchpad, and connectivity, with neither having a significant edge.</p><p> Game performance is similar, but the Asus G14 embraces AMD processors with up to eight cores. A well-equipped G14 will easily trounce the Acer in multi-core processor tests. Game performance is roughly similar when both are configured with an RTX 3060 graphics chip, with the Asus G14 having a slight edge.</p><p> While the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a better laptop overall, price is a factor. The Asus G14 is sold for $1,500 when configured with Nvidia’s RTX 3060 and is harder to find in stock. Paying a bit more for the Asus G14 makes sense to content creators who need its superior processor performance, but gamers could find more value in Acer’s alternative.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Excellent value for an RTX-powered gaming laptop.</strong></p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is an excellent value that has what gamers want: a great gaming experience and a quality display. Its short battery life and mediocre multi-core processor hold it back in everyday use, but the laptop’s competitive price makes these flaws easy to forgive.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-review-5069584" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-laptop-review-4795686" >Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-4779760" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Predator Triton 300 SE</li><li>Product Brand  Acer</li><li>MPN  PT314-51s-71UU</li><li>Price  $1,399.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2021</li><li>Weight  3.75 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.7 x 9 x 0.7 in.</li><li>Color  Silver</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>Platform  Windows 10</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i7-11375H</li><li>RAM  16GB</li><li>Storage  512GB</li><li>Camera  720p</li><li>Battery Capacity  60 watt-hour</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C 3.2 with DisplayPort mode and ThunderBolt 4, 2x USB-A 3.2, 1x HDMI 2.0, 1x 3.5mm audio jack</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

During my time with them, I spent dozens of hours comparing them.</p><p> That included seeing how quickly each console loaded and allowed me to immediately play a game and how simple it was to do so.</p><p> I also looked at the number of games available for each system, any advantages they offer, and whether the controller felt comfortable and intuitive to use.</p><p> I also considered possibly the most critical factor – how much fun it was to play on each console, which made me want to return for more.</p><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p> What to Look For</p><p> Buying a games console is never a cheap proposition, so buying the right one for you and your needs is essential, rather than making a mistake.</p><p> To help you figure out which game console is best for you, consider these key things before you buy:</p><p><strong>Who’s playing?</strong></p><p> All game consoles have a variety of games aimed at different age groups, but some are better for certain players than others.</p><p> For instance, PlayStation has many hard-hitting single-player experiences with stories exploring adult themes. It may also have games like Bluey and the Lego titles, but its strength is in more adult titles.</p><p> Alternatively, the Nintendo Switch has the Mario franchise, which is very family-friendly. Many couch co-op and multiplayer titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, offer a more sociable experience.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p> Do you already own a console? That can affect what your next one should be.</p><p> Almost all Xbox One accessories work with the Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, so if you already have some controllers or a headset, it makes sense to stick with the same ecosystem.</p><p> Also, if you have digital or physical copies of games, it’s worth checking if you can still play those on the new console.</p><p> The PS5 plays PS4 games, and the Xbox Series X&#x2F;S plays Xbox One games; however, the Switch isn’t backward compatible with the Nintendo Wii U.</p><p><strong>Convenience</strong></p><p> Some consoles are more portable than others. Something like the Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 will live under your TV or next to your monitor and can’t easily be transported elsewhere.</p><p> The Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck work portably and are docked to a screen. It’s worth considering how important portability is for you. Generally, consoles that solely work via a TV or monitor tend to be more powerful, but you miss out on quickly taking it out with you.</p><p> The newest gaming consoles can be pricey, but you don’t have to spend much for an exciting gaming experience. For instance, Nintendo’s consoles, on average, cost about $100 less than many of its competitors. You can also find great deals on classic systems.</p><p> If you’ve previously owned a gaming console, you should consider buying a new one compatible with the library of games you’ve likely collected.</p><p> For example, newer PlayStations won’t play games from older Sony consoles, but you can still access hundreds of older PlayStation titles using the PS Now streaming service.</p><p> On the other hand, Xbox consoles have much better backward compatibility, not to mention a digital redemption scheme that lets you download newer versions of your existing games for free.</p><p> How important is it to you to be able to play your favorite games in true 4K? If your answer is “very,” you’ll want a console that supports 2160p or higher, but if your answer is “not really,” you can settle for something else.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 is designed to deliver high-performance features in a low-budget package; this model has a great range and a high-intensity LED display. Let’s take a closer look at some strengths and weaknesses to evaluate what kind of performance you can expect on the road.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-bit-cheap"><a href="#Design-A-bit-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Design: A bit cheap"></a><strong>Design:</strong> <strong>A bit cheap</strong></h2><p> The S55 is palm-sized, about comparable in size and shape to most other radar detectors. The plastic material feels a bit cheaper than other radar detectors I’ve tested, though the control buttons worked well and felt long-lasting and I never had issues with them sticking. The Passport S55 comes with a very small windshield mount that’s functional, but you may want to consider an aftermarket mount. It’s minimal with small suction cups and I’m not confident it will last long. Luckily, the lightweight design of the S55 means it doesn’t need much to hold it in place.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display shows bright red text&#x2F;symbols for maximum visibility while driving. The S55 can show four signal strength meters at the same time, plus the numeric frequency of alerts. There’s also a dark mode that turns off the display but doesn’t disable the audio alert.</p><p> The speaker on this radar detector is very small, about a quarter-inch square, but the audio alerts are high volume. You can select between standard and loud tones. The SmartCord power cable for the S55 has a handy mute button on it so you don’t have to reach over the dash.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-installation"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-installation" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy installation"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy installation</strong></h2><p> The S55 is straightforward and easy to install. Simply stick the windshield mount in place and plug the SmartCord lighter adapter into your car’s DC cigarette lighter input. Plugging the modular jack into the S55 will automatically power on the radar detector and you can quickly customize settings for display brightness, detector sensitivity levels, and volume. Then you’re ready to hit the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631722&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frontpage2-2048x588.webp"                      border="0"                >EmEditor Professional (Lifetime License, non-store app)</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Impressive-detection"><a href="#Range-Impressive-detection" class="headerlink" title="Range: Impressive detection"></a><strong>Range: Impressive detection</strong></h2><p> The Passport S55 features Enhanced Radar Protection that delivers long-distance range for laser and radar bands, including K and Ka bands, widely used microwave frequencies for police radar guns. It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity. While testing the S55 in Highway mode I received Ka-band alerts over a mile and a half out from where I approached a highway patrol parked on the median of the interstate. This range was on par with much more expensive models.</p><p> It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## **Performance: Not exactly enhanced**<p> The S55 has different modes designed to adjust to specific frequency bands and sensitivity levels for city or highway driving. You can quickly customize the settings by using the included quick reference guide. You can also turn off specific frequency bands if they tend to give a lot of false alerts.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><p> In terms of false alerts, the AutoSensitivity feature didn’t really help in directing the overall high-sensitivity. This radar detector gave frequent false alerts from commercial door-openers and vehicle anti-collision warning systems. Unfortunately, the S55 lacks the advanced filters of more expensive models that help reduce the annoying frequency of false alerts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3922934&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/ripperpro.png"                      border="0"                >WonderFox DVD Ripper Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for"><a href="#Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for" class="headerlink" title="Price: You get what you pay for"></a><strong>Price: You get what you pay for</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $128, the Passport S55 is a low-end radar detector priced accordingly. More advanced radar detectors can easily be several hundred dollars more expensive, and the S55 is a good deal if you plan to use it primarily on the highway. Door-openers along the city and commercial roads will frequently trigger false alerts.

The Uniden DFR9 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Uniden-DFR9-Detection-Cameras-Display/dp/B07F6PZXHM/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799949%7Cncd245a3f879640b69fbbb5e95c20e78e20%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a model that can be considered the next price tier above the S55. The DFR9’s MSRP is $300 but it can often be found on sale for about $270.</p><p> The DFR9 has an excellent detection range and a color LED display. The DFR9 also features GPS technology that filters out stationary false alerts, a welcome addition in mid-level radar detectors, and supports database access which alerts you to red light and speed camera locations.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A basic radar detector that’s ideal for beginners or anyone on a budget.</strong></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 has reliable long-range detection, but I found its performance and range of features to be pretty basic. This unit never missed the presence of parked police down the highway who appeared to be using radar guns, which means I’m confident in recommending this model for those on a budget. However, buyer beware that false alerts are an unavoidable inconvenience with this model.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Passport S55</li><li>Product Brand  Escort</li><li>SKU  B019HF60EI</li><li>Price  $189.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.6 x 3.75 x 1 in.</li><li>Warranty  Limited One Year Warranty</li><li>Display size  1&#x2F;4”H x 1 3&#x2F;4”L</li><li>Display type  280 LED Matrix&#x2F;Text</li><li>Radar receiver  Superheterodyne, Varactor-Tuned VCO, Scanning Frequency, Discriminator, Digital Signal Processing (DSP)</li><li>Power requirements  12 VDC, Negative Ground (car lighter&#x2F;accessory)</li><li>GPS  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

The ASUS BW-16D1X-U measures 2.48 x 6.50 x 9.57 inches, making it a bit of a desk hog, but with that extra size, you get serious performance for every task.</p><p> The ASUS BW-16D1X-U has fast access times on all types of optical media, so you’ll spend less time waiting around. It can access CD-ROM at 160ms, DVD-ROM at 170ms, and BD-ROM at 180ms. Its read and write performance is also stellar, with 40x, 16x, and 8x read speeds in CD, DVD, and Blu-ray, respectively. Likewise, it can burn CD-R at 40x, DVD-R at 16x, and BD-R at 16x.</p><p> So, whether you want to rip media from discs or burn data to them, the Asus BW-16D1X-U can do the job quickly. It also supports BDXL, allowing storage of up to 128GB on a single, compatible disc. Making the package even sweeter, the ASUS BW-16D1X-U supports Windows and Mac computers.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-bw-16d1x-u-blu-ray-drive-review-4774686" >Asus BW-16D1X-U Powerful Blu-ray Drive Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.advancedwebranking.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715051&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/14edc6ebfdae2e23bbed83d67f50e983/products/33_awr%20logo.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Budget-Buy"><a href="#Budget-Buy" class="headerlink" title="Budget Buy"></a>Budget Buy</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >LG GP65NB60 External Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Txzj4YX23tuIUnOsOlRGMfzEON8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/lg-electronics-8x-usb-20-super-multi-ultra-slim-portable-dvd-writer-drive---rw-external-drive-with-m-disc-support-black-gp65nb60-e74c64d858fc4e968d809333a31078d1.jpg" >LG Electronics 8X USB 2.0 Super Multi Ultra Slim Portable DVD Writer Drive +&#x2F;-RW External Drive with M-DISC Support (Black) GP65NB60 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >$25 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Reads and writes CDs and DVDs</li><li>Lightweight and very portable</li><li>You have color options</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Cheap build quality</li><li>Poorly designed eject function</li></ul><p> If you don’t need the Blu-ray capabilities offered by some of the more premium external optical drives, you can get a great deal on a CD&#x2F;DVD drive. LG’s GP65NB60 is a low-profile and affordable combo drive that offers both read and write capability for CD and DVD. Measuring 0.6 x 5.4 x 5.6 inches and weighing just 0.4 pounds, it even gives our top compact pick a run for its money.</p><p> The LG GP65NB60 can read CD-ROM at 24x speeds and DVD-ROM at 8x speeds, meaning it’s not lagging behind most of the competition despite its budget price. Write speeds are also decent, with up to 24x on CD-R and up to 8x on DVD-R.</p><p> The LG GP65NB60 needs a single USB connection for all its power and data transfer needs. Further rounding out the package, the LG GP65NB60 supports Windows and Mac, can burn archival-quality M-Disc, and comes in various colors, with black, gold, white, and silver on offer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1567905/13846" target="_top" id="1567905"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1567905"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1567905/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Most-Compact"><a href="#Most-Compact" class="headerlink" title="Most Compact"></a>Most Compact</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >Verbatim External Slimline Blu-ray Writer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BO4kmGezMrCvhvw2CCVi4n592BU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/verbatim-external-cd-dvd-blu-ray-writer-usb-30-m-disc-ready---movie-playback-requires-playback-software-not-included-67c2a99c85c4425298b176462124e43b.jpg" >Verbatim External CD DVD Blu-ray Writer USB 3.0 M-Disc Ready - Movie playback requires playback software (not included) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >$126 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Solid metal case</li><li>M-Disc support</li><li>Comes with USB Type-C adapter</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Doesn’t include software</li><li>Isn’t cheap</li><li>Fragile tray</li></ul><p> Many modern laptops forgo an optical drive to trim their size and weight. But that reduction wouldn’t be valuable if you need an optical drive.</p><p> Measuring just 0.45 x 5.24 x 5.75 inches, the Verbatim 70102 is super compact. What’s more, the reduction in size doesn’t mean a bunch of compromises. It’s built with metal housing for a premium look and feel and is speedy.</p><p> It can write CDs at 24x, DVDs at 8x, and Blu-rays at 6x — even supporting M-Disc. It’s a CD&#x2F;DVD&#x2F;BD drive weighing less than half a pound. The Verbatim 70102 is a mobility champion, with power and data transfer over USB, so you’ll only need one cable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Budget-Alternative"><a href="#Budget-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Budget Alternative"></a>Budget Alternative</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >Dell DW316 External USB Slim DVD Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uXbXWSHrSmk0WgSQeogs9WgkNz0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/dell-usb-dvd-drive-dw316--black-5ec791f7068744c3bc87e2e91130a9c1.jpg" >dell-usb-dvd-drive-dw316–black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >$26 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/EXT-USB-SLIM-DVD-RW-OPTICAL-DRIVE-429-AAUX/44933803" >$34 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-usb-slim-dvd-rw-drive-plug-and-play-dw316-black/4697703.p?skuId=4697703" >$40 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Works immediately</li><li>Includes DVD burning software</li><li>Easy to move around</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>A bit pricey for what you get</li><li>Flimsy exterior</li></ul><p> The Dell DW316 measures 0.55 x 5.41 x 5.67 inches, making it both a budget and compact contender.

It boasts maximum read speeds of 24x for CDs and 8x for DVDs, and it can provide those same speeds for writing as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.dbschema.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19867419&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/176b22bab4e94a28619ca2433b2ef241/products/1_icon256.png"                      border="0"                ><br>DbSchema database designer for all databases, schema design in the team, schema deployment, interactive diagrams, documentation, data and query tools. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Compact-Alternative"><a href="#Compact-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Compact Alternative"></a>Compact Alternative</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A27IUUM?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB01A27IUUM" >ASUS ZenDrive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FMO3nyGMV3u3QFC7RoNQrMLyTbg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/asus-zendrive-ultra-slim-usb-20-external-8x-dvd-optical-drive---rw-with-m-disc-support-for-windows-and-mac-and-nero-backitup-for-android-devices-3c25db5d367c4a90ba3a66757967b883.jpg" >BackItUp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A27IUUM?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB01A27IUUM" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A27IUUM?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB01A27IUUM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A27IUUM?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB01A27IUUM" >$30 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-zendrive-8x-max-dvd-write-speed-external-usb-2-0-dvdrw-cd-rw-drive-black/6285911.p?skuId=6285911" >$38 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1224925-REG/asus%5Fsdrw%5F08u7m%5Fu%5Fblk%5Fg%5Fas%5Fzendrive%5Fu7m%5Fexternal%5Fultra%5Fslim.html" >$30 at B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Slim design</li><li>Optional encryption functionality</li><li>Ships with software included</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Doesn’t work with Blu-rays</li><li>Might be loud at times</li></ul><p> Where a compact footprint counts, ASUS’s ultra-slim ZenDrive is a quality pick.

Furthering that performance are quick access times; the Asus ZenDrive can access CD and DVD content in 160ms. For anyone who needs archival quality, the ZenDrive also supports burning to M-Disc for long-lasting data storage.</p><p> The Asus ZenDrive supports Windows and Mac, and it includes CyberLink software to help you get started storing content on physical media. The drive also comes with six months of free cloud storage from ASUS, so you can rip content from your CDs and DVDs and move it there as needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For"><a href="#What-to-Look-For" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For"></a>What to Look For</h2><p> For people who own and consume lots of media, an indispensable external optical drive is one of your best bets. External optical drives allow you to store massive amounts of data, including photos, videos, and software from CDs and DVDs, with easy access whenever and wherever you need it.</p><p> With hundreds of external optical drives on the market, finding the right one may take a lot of work. However, we’ve narrowed our top selections to the top four. We evaluated using five criteria: connectivity, compatibility, read&#x2F;write speeds, portability, and optional features such as low power consumption and M-Disc support.</p><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p><p> Our preferred external optical drive supports USB 3.0 or higher for faster data transfer speeds. It should also be compatible with Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android OS, and FireOS, which is preferable for users with multiple devices running different file types of all sizes.</p><p> Almost all external optical drives have a micro USB port, although the larger mini USB can save more files.</p><p> Other areas to consider with connectivity include BDXL support, which allows you to store all your files on a 128GB disc.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p> In addition to supporting standard CDs and DVDs, bolster your data processing power by choosing models with Blu-ray disc support. Ensure your preferred format is supported to avoid any returns due to compatibility issues.</p><p> If you store a lot of precious digital data, like family photos, you may want to explore external optical drives offering M-Disc support. These drives promise to last 1,000 years versus 7-10 years for standard DVDs before losing image quality.</p><p><strong>Read&#x2F;Write Speeds</strong></p><p> In short, the faster the read and write speeds, the quicker it will take to transfer large files or burn discs. Read speeds indicate how long it takes to open files, while write speeds indicate how long it takes to save data. At a minimum, look for read and write speeds of 40x (CDs), 16x (DVDs), and 16x (Blu-ray), although the higher, the better. No wonder why our Best Overall pick is the ASUS BW-16D1X-U Blu-ray Drive with read speeds of 8x (Blu-ray), 16x (DVD), and 40x (CD) versus write speeds of 16x (BD-R), 16x (DVD), and 40x (CD).</p><p><strong>Portability</strong></p><p> If you’re constantly on the go, we highly recommend a slim and lightweight design that is easy to carry around. One perfect example is the LG GP65NB60 External Drive, which is only 0.6 x 5.4 x 5.6 inches. It should be small enough to fit in a laptop bag, person, or backpack. Plus, many of them come with integrated cables, which keep your bags clutter-free and cord-free.</p><p><strong>Optional Features</strong></p><p> Other areas to consider when choosing an external optical drive are its durability and build quality. Check for ones with anti-scratch coatings, shock resistance, and sturdy construction to withstand wear and tear, especially when traveling, as they constantly get knocked in your luggage.</p><p> On the usability side, you may also enjoy external optical drives with silent operation and low power consumption, which offer a more comfortable working environment.</p><p> Kudos for any external optical drive with M-Disc support, as well as bundled backup software or free subscriptions to cloud services that offer even more robust backups.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-cd-players-and-changers-1846562" >The Best CD Players and CD Changers of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What are the advantages of an optical drive?<br> With media increasingly moving to digital rather than physical storage solutions, an optical drive may seem outdated. But there are still many reasons to invest in an optical drive, not the least of which is to access older media, a significant percentage of which still hasn’t been shifted to a digital&#x2F;online solution. This is especially true if you have games, videos, photos, or documents backed up on physical media. Optical drives can also be a handy way to create new backups quickly and inexpensively, and some programs require discs for emergency boot tools.</li><li>Can you read a DVD in a Blu-Ray drive?<br> Yes, both CDs and DVDs are compatible with Blu-Ray drives, and there are combo drives that can burn discs of all three types as well. By contrast, DVD drives cannot read Blu-Ray media.</li><li>How does an optical drive work?<br> Optical drives read and write data to discs using a laser. The laser creates pits in an organic dye layer on the disc’s surface to write, the reflected light from which can then be read by photodiodes in the drive and converted back into the original data. The disc spins, allowing the laser to read the tracks on its surface consecutively. If you’re not using a CD, dozens of supported YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-spotify-4685829" >Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> channels specialize in Karaoke videos, such as Singtrix and Sing King.

This tiny sensor, once installed, transmits codes, errors, and information via Bluetooth to the BlueDriver app. This app is the centerpiece of the whole unit, as it’s one of the most beautifully designed and full-featured pieces of software we’ve seen. You can call up codes, search them, and even set the app into HUD mode to treat it as an onboard meter.</p><p> What’s extra interesting about this is the 24&#x2F;7 support, meaning you can contact an actual human if you need more information on a particular reading. You can even have the app generate on-demand repair reports compiled and verified by certified technicians. These repair reports are pulled from a database of over 6.6 million vehicle-specific diagnostics, so chances are, you can pull one up for your specific vehicle.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Yes |<strong>Built-in Display:</strong> No |<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 2.2”x1.9”x1” |<strong>Weight:</strong> 2.08 Oz</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Car Code Reader"></a>What to Look For in a Car Code Reader</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1922358/21553" target="_top" id="1922358"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1922358"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1922358/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Ease of Use"></a>Ease of Use</h3><p> If you haven’t had a car code reader before, purchase a simple one.

A car code reader lets you read and clear codes, view basic parameter IDs, and check and reset readiness monitors. This gives you an excellent way to tell if the problem is something you can fix quickly before shelling out to a car shop, potentially saving you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars.</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Onboard GPS is a huge selling point for shoppers who prefer to leave their<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at home while they work out.</p><p> The improved Pure Pulse heart-rate tracking technology and active intensity minutes could offer more detailed goal tracking to some users. Android users can reply to texts and calls directly from the device. Fitbit Pay is supported, as are music integrations with Pandora, Deezer, and Spotify. Finally, voice assistant support comes from Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant (forthcoming), amplifying the wear-and-go convenience for busy routines.</p><p> I used the Versa 3 as my go-to tracker for runs, walks, and telling time, too. Overall it was almost unnoticeable on my wrist, when I could get the right fit, though I didn’t always have the easiest time interacting with it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ceE1xxVfUTF44pCOtEXiO6JW_IA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Versa-3-04-ef922812d0444da4a7277e91efe2fcf8.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa 3"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Sleek-and-smart-looking"><a href="#Design-Sleek-and-smart-looking" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek and smart-looking"></a>Design: Sleek and smart-looking</h2><p> The Fitbit Versa 3 resembles prior versions of the model, though with softer and more rounded edges meant to better contour to the wrist and offer faster response times, according to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-fitbit-4176010" >Fitbit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . While the standard model that I tested came with a silicone infinity sport band, there are several fancier watch bands available, including a quick-release band—if you opt for a special edition. This would certainly be preferable to the basic black version I tested, which really does look like a sports watch rather than a “regular” watch.</p><p> The Versa 3 has an attractive AMOLED display with three brightness settings. Sometimes I found the display difficult to read while outside unless the screen was set to the brightest level. And the hidden button was difficult to interact with. Located on the left side of the watch face, the button recedes into the device and requires full and direct contact to engage, especially when in motion. Another awkward design aspect is the screen wake function. The automatic setting, triggered by the turn of the wrist, was often slightly slow, and using the button&#x2F;tap prompt also sometimes took several taps.</p><p> In running mode, GPS signal capture was mostly instant, but it also frequently dropped.</p><p> This smartwatch is capable of storing five different watch faces, and while they’re easy to find, downloading a new face, just like all apps—took quite a while. The SPO2 watch face is compatible with the Versa 3, but you’ll have to pay for the Fitbit Premium app subscription to access this data in any meaningful way.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467"                      border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Lightweight-for-all-day-wear"><a href="#Comfort-Lightweight-for-all-day-wear" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Lightweight for all-day wear"></a>Comfort: Lightweight for all-day wear</h2><p> I found the Fitbit Versa 3 to be pleasantly lightweight and easy to wear for the whole day. Sleeping with it was never an issue, and the sleep mode setting was easy to turn on for uninterrupted sleep. Showering with the device was also uneventful, though I found that the side button was somehow turned on by contact with the water. I’m not sure how this bodes for swimming workouts with this device, which it’s supposed to be able to handle with its 50-meter water resistance.</p><p> Shoppers looking for the best-fitting smartwatches for women will appreciate the standard small band and the option of swapping it out with the provided large band if you need extra notches. While comfortable to wear because of the light build, finding the right fit, especially after I briefly removed the watch, was a bit tricky at first. But once I got it in the right place, I barely noticed it over the course of a full day.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3922934&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/ripperpro.png"                      border="0"                >WonderFox DVD Ripper Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/R_j7dFFwnlWoGyar6N0dYZREqIM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Versa-3-02-8b212782c0f245459f26ffaa0e2982e2.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa 3"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Performance-Accuracy-slightly-questionable"><a href="#Performance-Accuracy-slightly-questionable" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Accuracy slightly questionable"></a>Performance: Accuracy slightly questionable</h2><p> In true Fitbit brand fashion, the Fitbit Versa 3 supports wellness in a big-picture way. There are over 20 different workout modes and several, such as running, elliptical exercise, swimming, biking, and aerobic workouts, are automatically detected.</p><p> I used the running mode most frequently and saved that activity as a shortcut, which made launching a workout speedy. In most cases, GPS signal capture was instant, but it also frequently dropped—though it came back pretty quickly. This could explain the discrepancy when compared to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-venu-review-4843916" >Garmin Venu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the course of several two- and three-mile runs. The Versa 3 lagged behind by as much as 30 seconds. Resting heart rate was also pretty off when compared to the Venu—faster by almost 8bpm (beats per minute)—and that’s the biggest gap I saw while on a run as well.</p><p> Generally, whether logging a run, walk, or weight training workout, I found it best to leave the display set to always on. Otherwise, it was nearly impossible to get the screen to wake when I needed it to. The default screen timeout is only 8 seconds, which is customizable. But in the interest of preserving battery life, I left it as-is, even though it didn’t provide a huge window of opportunity. While running especially, even with the display always on, getting the display to come on to pause or resume workouts wasn’t very smooth.</p><p> I found that the workout summary on the device itself is easy to follow and review, but the app provides more valuable insights, such as information about heart rate zones and active minute zones by cardio and fat burn.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XaHqGkkkpkk1u4lozEYs71XuROc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Versa-3-05-95e58759793b422db3ebd22cf177f2ba.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa 3"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Lasts-for-a-solid-six-days"><a href="#Battery-Lasts-for-a-solid-six-days" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Lasts for a solid six days"></a>Battery: Lasts for a solid six days</h2><p> Like the Fitbit Sense, the Fitbit Versa 3 is supposed to last for over six days on a single charge when the display is not set to “always on.” My experience yielded six days before the battery was critically low. This could be because I chose to download and use the Fitbit SPO2 watch face that measures blood oxygen saturation. Fitbit says this face could accelerate the need for charging. Otherwise, I used<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-gps-how-it-works-4688647" >GPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for about 30 minutes each day and only streamed music via Spotify for 2 hours total.</p><p> It charged from critically low to 100 percent in about 1.25 hours, which is in line with the 1-2 hour estimation by the manufacturer. A quick charge brought the device from 9 percent to 29 percent, which tracks with the claim that a 12-minute charge would bring it up to a full day of battery life.</p><h2 id="Software-Key-Features-Wellness-and-convenience-features-reign"><a href="#Software-Key-Features-Wellness-and-convenience-features-reign" class="headerlink" title="Software&#x2F;Key Features: Wellness and convenience features reign"></a>Software&#x2F;Key Features: Wellness and convenience features reign</h2><p> The Fitbit Versa 3 runs on the Fitbit OS and benefits from several upgrades. The latest smart features include a built-in speaker and microphone, which Android users can use to respond to phone calls along with sending replies and emojis when the phone is nearby. Sadly, iPhone users can only answer or reject calls and view notifications.</p><p> Both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-vs-android-best-smartphone-2000309" >Android and iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> users can also take advantage of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> voice prompts, which I found nice to have but limited and best for simple tasks such as setting reminders and timers. And since you have to launch the Alexa app itself to use, it makes sense to keep it in the list of app shortcuts. Additionally, the Fitbit app has to be active in the background for Alexa to work, so it’s hardly just as easy as calling out for Alexa to take advantage of the limited skills for this wearable.</p><p> It charged from critically low to 100 percent in about 1.25 hours, which is in line with the 1-2 hour estimation by the manufacturer.</p><p> For this particular device, the SPO2 monitoring is also a nice-to-have feature, but it only generates data based on a night of sleep, and the detailed metrics offered with the Fitbit Premium subscription don’t really get more detailed than showing a trend over time, in my opinion.</p><p> Unfortunately, I found that there’s little to do with this info. In fact, the printable wellness overview report doesn’t even include this data. The other wellness content, though, from meditation to recipes to workouts, all require the subscription, which the brand seems to be banking on enticing users to sign up for.</p><p> Another noteworthy upgrade for this model is the music streaming integration, which is a hit if you have a premium subscription to Deezer or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/pandora-internet-music-streaming-1847453" >Pandora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for on-device music storage. Otherwise, it’s more of a miss. Even if you’re a Spotify Premium user, at this point you can’t store music on the device. While it was somewhat convenient to control the Spotify mobile app from the Versa 3 rather than reaching for my phone, overall this feature wasn’t very incentivizing to use—especially since I couldn’t store music on the watch while on a run without my smartphone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Basic Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2f-G8JEK0Z63WAJEd2yrsI_9jDg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Versa-3-03-00c26852cbc94711a4bb6660b02e2550.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa 3"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Less-costly-than-similar-models"><a href="#Price-Less-costly-than-similar-models" class="headerlink" title="Price: Less costly than similar models"></a>Price: Less costly than similar models</h2><p> For $230, the Fitbit Versa 3 is less expensive than similar feature-rich smartwatches. Other models like the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2, come with available LTE, for even more connectivity and standalone convenience—and a significant price bump.</p><p> The Versa 3 is also about $100 cheaper than the Fitbit Sense, which offers a few more wellness-tracking flourishes such as the ECG app and EDA responses. The smartwatch claims to offer similarly accurate heart rate monitoring and onboard GPS and some users will still benefit from the array of wellness-centric features like reminders to move, food and water tracking, guided breathing, and all the smart features the more costly Sense has too.</p><h2 id="Fitbit-Versa-3-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Active2"><a href="#Fitbit-Versa-3-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Active2" class="headerlink" title="Fitbit Versa 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2"></a>Fitbit Versa 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2</h2><p> The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 is a close comparison to the Fitbit Versa 3. If you opt for GPS and cellular connectivity, it will cost about $380 and above, but you’ll also get a slew of additional smart features that surpass the Versa 3. You can take phone calls over Wi-Fi, control your camera, check social feeds, and listen to music on your run without your phone in your pocket.</p><p> In true Fitbit brand fashion, the Fitbit Versa 3 supports wellness in a big-picture way.</p><p> The Active2 has the same water-resistance rating as the Versa 3, but it’s also military-grade rugged. The round watch face and larger display are also potentially more appealing to traditional watch fans that want an accessory that transitions better from work to workouts. There are two buttons as well for easier interactions.</p><p> The Versa 3 has the upper hand when it comes to battery life. The Active2 will get you through the day, but not to (or potentially over) six days like the Versa 3. On the other hand, the Active2 can be charged using power share with compatible<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >Samsung smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is a convenience the Versa 3 doesn’t offer.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An effective fitness smartwatch that could compel some users to keep moving.</strong></p><p> The Fitbit Versa 3 is a lightweight wearable that offers an attractive blend of fitness and wellness-tracking tools and connected features. New on-device GPS, enhanced heart-rate monitoring, music controls, and the companion app could provide some users an easy deep dive into wellness trends along with desirable customization power. Those looking for added motivation to stay active may find it in this comfortable and capable wearable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Versa 3</li><li>Product Brand  Fitbit</li><li>MPN  FB511BKBK</li><li>Price  $229.95</li><li>Release Date  August 2020</li><li>Weight  0.7 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.59 x 1.59 x 0.49 in.</li><li>Color  Black&#x2F;Black Aluminum, Midnight&#x2F;Soft Gold Aluminum, Olive &#x2F; Soft Gold Aluminum, Pink Clay&#x2F;Soft Gold Aluminum, Thistle &#x2F; Soft Gold Aluminum</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Nonetheless, it’s still going to be the best choice for a really large segment of buyers out there simply because of how aggressively its priced.</p><p> If you are living inside of a large metropolitan area, you likely don’t need the best possible antenna to pick up the channels being broadcast to you over the air. Furthermore, I didn’t see that big of a difference in performance as price increased. Unless you step it all the way up to a much larger, much more expensive solution, the difference in performance is probably not worth it, which is why the 1byone is an easy recommendation.

The 13.25 x 9.25 inch antenna surface is roughly in line with most of the other products I looked at in this category, the only real difference being that the 1byone has a much more rigid surface.</p><p> Being a powered antenna, the 1byone uses an external amplifier to boost the signal. This box contains a coaxial input attached via the included 16.5ft cable, and has a power input, which can be supplied by the TV itself if it can support USB power. Otherwise, 1byone includes a USB power adapter.</p><h2 id="Setup-Fairly-intuitive"><a href="#Setup-Fairly-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Fairly intuitive"></a><strong>Setup: Fairly intuitive</strong></h2><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas. Simply attach the 16.5ft coaxial cable to the external amplifier, connect the power to a USB power source, and then attach the coaxial cable from the amplifier to your TV.</p><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Performance-Good-enough-for-most"><a href="#Performance-Good-enough-for-most" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Good enough for most"></a><strong>Performance: Good enough for most</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna didn’t have the best performance of the antennas we’ve tested, falling somewhere in the middle of the pack. In my channel acquisition test, I averaged 59 channels across all the tests performed. This compares to the worst performing antenna at just 47, and the best at 76.</p><p> This should be more than suitable for most people living within a city in relatively close proximity to the source of the TV signal.

Given how many factors impact the effective range, I think it is somewhat wise not to make any promises. Nonetheless, this is clearly a device that will be best suited for people living in or near major metropolitan areas.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6y-ITpY8n7xf8BteMqdJjYm-paU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_05-178a02351af040cc89c86169b88a6de2.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-A-great-deal"><a href="#Price-A-great-deal" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great deal"></a><strong>Price: A great deal</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna costs just $25, making it the least expensive option out of the antennas I tested. It picked up all the major channels that I would actually watch, and didn’t have any issues with the signal. So from my perspective, why would I pay more? I think buyers would probably be best served by seeing if an antenna like this works for them.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Working on the go can prove difficult on a laptop, especially when you need to work on heavy-hitting projects requiring precision. Travel mice, or portable computer mice that can be packed and unpacked on the go, can alleviate much of the proverbial headache of working on PC-heavy tasks. For those who prefer their mouse have a cable, the Sabrent fits the bill. Using high definition precision technology, the tiny, three-year-old mouse is designed for those who want convenience and extreme precision in their work.</p><h2 id="Design-Basic"><a href="#Design-Basic" class="headerlink" title="Design: Basic"></a><strong>Design: Basic</strong></h2><p> The Sabrent was not designed for heavy gaming in mind; its design is so tiny at 3.2 x 1.5 inches (LW) that it fits into the cup of your palm with some room to spare. Unlike gaming mice, which can be complex, with a plethora of buttons&#x2F;features, the all-black, 1.5-ounce mouse only has three buttons: the left (main) button, the wheel, and the right button. While this might turn off many users, in reality, it turns out to be of huge benefit. Thanks to its simplicity, ambidextrous users will appreciate its ability to swap between dominant hands.</p><p> Thanks to its simplicity, ambidextrous users will appreciate its ability to swap between dominant hands.</p><p> It’s important to keep in mind that this is a wired, ergonomic mouse that relies on a USB port connection. So while it doesn’t require any batteries, it can be problematic if you need more than 25 inches the cable provides. The cable itself expands with a gentle pull of the cable from its own mini-port, and is easily retractable with a tug on each side of the cable. Just be careful when retracting it, as it is similar to a window shade in that it retracts with near-violent gusto.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/E-UHv94vEiLyLkgwTG1qIFE6uvQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Sabrent_Travel_Mouse_04-76e4b475ca3f4449a746c22f3713f784.jpg"                      alt="Sabrent Mini Travel Mouse"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> The cable’s addition increases the size of the mouse, bringing the total measurements to 6.44 x 1.5x 2.44 inches (LWH). The Sabrent also comes with a mesh carrying bag, making it easy to pack up and take on the go without scratching it.

Expanding the cable and plugging it into the PC’s USB port allows the Sabrent to self-install. In under less than a minute, the plug and play features kick in. If you need to alter it to suit ambidextrous needs, you’ll need to head into the control panel of your PC to make the swap. Those requiring left-handed features will need to alter it.

While 1200 dpi is minimal in comparison to some of the other heavy-hitting mice on the market, this mouse wasn’t designed to be used as a gaming mouse—it was designed in mind that you could take it and pack it on the go and get the job done.</p><p> After using it for over 25 hours, the precision blew us away; even the smallest twitch of the mouse registered movement on the PC and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/computer-and-laptop-reviews-4102643" >laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we tested it across. Not once did we have to reclick on an item because the Sabrent failed to register the movement, proving that the cable was of speedy and accurate benefit to the mouse. The speed of the mouse highlighted its precision, darting across the monitor screens as we shifted the mouse instantaneously.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZAK9csfHFEKVkNFSzE-Knbqabgs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Sabrent_Travel_Mouse_03-c6a7b875505642c69218c2c6c3449e50.jpg"                      alt="Sabrent Mini Travel Mouse"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> The buttons responded quickly and with ease as well. While the main and right buttons do click with some noise, the constant clacking won’t get on any nerves. The scroller isn’t loud, but it took us a couple rolls of the wheel before it shifted around without any resistance. This ultimately wasn’t a big deal, but it might need a little breaking in, so don’t give up on it straight away.</p><p> We used the mouse for up to eight hours at a time in testing, and our muscles didn’t tire out and hands didn’t cramp, which was a testament to the ergonomic design.</p><p> The cable length left something to be desired in a work PC, however. At 25 inches, it sounds like a dream come true, however, testing it on a standing desk where the PC tower is located further away from the keyboard and mouse we realized there was a problem. The length cable prevented us from shifting our grip on the mouse, and the tugging was a frustrating physical constraint. Laptop users won’t even notice the cable, but PC users may want to look for something a little more wireless.</p><h2 id="Comfort-Too-small"><a href="#Comfort-Too-small" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Too small"></a><strong>Comfort: Too small</strong></h2><p> Because the mouse is so tiny, and barely fit into the palm of our hand, we constantly had to adjust our fingers to compensate for its size. Granted, we used the mouse for up to eight hours at a time in testing, and our muscles didn’t tire out and hands didn’t cramp, which was a testament to the ergonomic design. However, constantly having to shift our grip to press buttons and scroll was mildly annoying, especially when we were deeply engaged in work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/h8ibsbPtDqgJOD0XgpZSD6FOXUU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Sabrent_Travel_Mouse_02-1331828bbc3f460baebd85cbd24d61e2.jpg"                      alt="Sabrent Mini Travel Mouse"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Reasonable"><a href="#Price-Reasonable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable</strong></h2><p> At around $7, this is a great budget mouse. Essentially, the cost is for basic mouse features, and not for anything heavier or more taxing on a PC. If you’re looking for a travel mouse with more features, then expect to spend more. However, if accomplishing work tasks is solely your task then this is the perfect price point.</p><h2 id="Sabrent-Mini-Travel-Mouse-vs-VicTsing-Wireless-Mouse"><a href="#Sabrent-Mini-Travel-Mouse-vs-VicTsing-Wireless-Mouse" class="headerlink" title="Sabrent Mini Travel Mouse vs. VicTsing Wireless Mouse"></a><strong>Sabrent Mini Travel Mouse vs. VicTsing Wireless Mouse</strong></h2><p> Because the mouse is so tiny, we also tested the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/victsing-wireless-mouse-review-4799129" >VicTsing Wireless Mouse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/VicTsing-Wireless-Portable-Receiver-Adjustable/dp/B013WC0P2A/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799034%7Cn6493c6f4bf4b471ba05fab7dd162554120%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) to get a feel as to which mouse is the better option for a portable, travel mouse. The answer turned out to be more complicated: whereas the Sabrent was more ideal for ambidextrous travel, the VicTsing Wireless Mouse was geared more for right-handed users who prefer adjustable and wireless features.</p><p> Both of the mice are cost-effective, with the Sabrent running around $7, and the VicTsing setting a user back around $12. The Sabrent’s size makes the ergonomic-friendly VicTsing look like a giant, despite it only being around 1.5 inches longer and 0.5 inches wider. What’s strange, though, is that ultimately, we felt that a larger mouse didn’t help our hands in this case. The VitTsing’s buttons gave us some resistance, and we felt it was easier to click links and work with Photoshop with the Sabrent. While the VicTsing comes with a DPI that can be adjusted with a button located on its top, the Sabrent leaps out of the box with a fast, reliable DPI. If you’re looking for a more comfortable grip, the VicTsing will probably be a more ideal choice. However, if size and a quick DPI is necessary, then the Sabrent is a solid choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/victsing-wireless-mouse-review-4799129" >VicTsing Wireless Mouse Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A solid, cost-conscious travel mouse.</strong></p><p> While we constantly had to shift our grip on the tiny Sabrent mouse, we really liked its portability and fast, accurate movements. The cable proved to be difficult for desktop use, however, laptop users will enjoy the speeds that accompany the wired cable.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Mini Travel USB Optical Mouse</li><li>Product Brand  Sabrent</li><li>SKU  MS-OPMN</li><li>Price  $7.00</li><li>Release Date  November 2016</li><li>Product Dimensions  6.44 x 1.5 x 2.44 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Compatibility  Windows 2000 and up, Mac OS X and up, Linux systems</li><li>Connectivity options  USB Port, NOT Bluetooth Enabled</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active.

Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Looks good</li><li>Samsung Health features are insightful</li><li>Bright and vibrant screen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Android-only</li><li>Non Samsung users need to install extra apps</li></ul><p> Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.</p><p> What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><p> Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes.

The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.</p><p> Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The best jump starters blend portability with reliability. Most importantly, it needs to resurrect your car, every time, as quickly as possible (and with minimal hassle). On the other hand, for all the times you’re not in an emergency situation, it needs to tuck neatly away in your car, and not hog a ton of valuable real estate. To find out just how well the DBPOWER 600A Peak 18000mAh Portable Car Jump Starter struck this balance we purposefully drained a car’s battery and got to work testing.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-rugged-brick-of-power-contained-within-its-own-nice-case"><a href="#Design-A-rugged-brick-of-power-contained-within-its-own-nice-case" class="headerlink" title="Design: A rugged brick of power contained within its own nice case"></a><strong>Design: A rugged brick of power contained within its own nice case</strong></h2><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case with a relatively durable zipper holding the two sides of the case together. One side contains the unit itself within a foam insert, and the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. The idea here is that you can keep the case stashed in your trunk or under a seat and have everything you need.</p><p> The unit itself is a surprisingly small red and black brick, constructed out of plastic that feels both rugged and yet somehow also soft to the touch. There’s a flashlight on one end of the unit that is mounted flush within the case and on one corner of the case there’s a compass; presumably for the times where you get really lost. All the device’s inputs, outputs, the display, and the on&#x2F;off switch are found on one of the longer sides. No cables stick out from the unit itself, as you must use one of the accessories to enable the device to do any of its actual work.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> The accessory kit contains a wall charger and a 12V port charger for the unit, a DC cable, and a variety of ends to allow for charging a laptop. The jumper cables sprout from a module that plugs into a specific port on the unit and terminate in your standard clamps. The module itself has a status light that illuminates to indicate the unit’s readiness to jump start the car.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Basic Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-The-cables-are-short-but-easy-to-use"><a href="#Setup-Process-The-cables-are-short-but-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: The cables are short but easy to use"></a><strong>Setup Process: The cables are short but easy to use</strong></h2><p> It’s a breeze using the 600A to jump start a car. You plug the jumper cable module into the unit, which will cause its module light to flash green, then connect the red clamp to the positive terminal on your car’s battery and the black clamp to the negative terminal which will cause the module light to illuminate solid green. With our test vehicle it was a little difficult to get the clamps on the negative terminal as they are a little large, and the cables themselves are on the short side. With the clamps in position all that is left is to start the car and remove the clamps in reverse order.</p><p>It’s a breeze using the 600A to jump start a car.</p><p> If it’s other devices that need power, you simply need to turn the unit on and then plug them into the appropriate port. For a laptop, that means you must pick the correct adapter, use the power button to switch the unit to the right power mode for your laptop, and plug it into the DC power port. For a phone or other USB device you pretty much just need to pick one of the two ports and plug in, though the smart port provides better amperage and faster charging.</p><h2 id="Performance-Immediate-power-to-get-you-back-on-the-road"><a href="#Performance-Immediate-power-to-get-you-back-on-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Immediate power to get you back on the road"></a><strong>Performance: Immediate power to get you back on the road</strong></h2><p> When it comes to its ability to provide power, the DBPOWER Portable Jump Starter doesn’t disappoint. It reliably started a 2011 Hyundai Elantra that had a battery depleted down to 10V with zero issues, multiple times. With as small as it is, we did have some (thankfully unfounded) concerns that the unit might slide down into the engine bay as soon as the engine started.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> Charging USB devices is not only simple but fast as well, with a sustained 1,200 mAh current. This level of charging will top off your devices in a hurry, and with 18,000 mAh capacity the unit should be able to charge a phone like the Samsung Galaxy S10 five times over. Be aware that if your phone uses a USB-C or Thunderbolt connection you’ll need to provide your own cable.</p><h2 id="Key-Features-A-decent-flashlight-and-oddly-a-compass"><a href="#Key-Features-A-decent-flashlight-and-oddly-a-compass" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: A decent flashlight and, oddly, a compass"></a><strong>Key Features: A decent flashlight and, oddly, a compass</strong></h2><p> Small as it’s, the DBPOWER Portable Jump Starter has a few extra features of note. The flashlight built into the case is decent, but doesn’t put out much light and does so within a relatively narrow angle. However, with as small as the unit is, you can easily just hold the whole thing in your hand like a flashlight to illuminate whatever you need.</p><p>It packs a ton of value into its diminutive size.</p><p> As mentioned before the case does have a compass on it, which is a curious addition to a tool such as this. It’s quite small and is neither illuminated nor does it glow in the dark. We suppose it might be useful to get your bearings in an unfamiliar area, but chances are decent you’re just going to get the car jump started and get back on the road instead.</p><p> Speaking of which, one method of charging the device is through<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >your car’s 12V power port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This means that you can pop the hood on a car with a dead battery, get it jump started, and then use the running car to charge the jump starter as you drive to your next destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Price-A-low-cost-for-such-a-feature-packed-jump-starter"><a href="#Price-A-low-cost-for-such-a-feature-packed-jump-starter" class="headerlink" title="Price: A low cost for such a feature-packed jump starter"></a><strong>Price: A low cost for such a feature-packed jump starter</strong></h2><p> You can find this model available online for between $70 and $75, and at that price point it packs a ton of value into its diminutive size. There are other units that are a little less expensive, but generally at the expense of some features or included accessories.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Splitting-hairs-on-what-features-matter-most-to-you"><a href="#Competition-Splitting-hairs-on-what-features-matter-most-to-you" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Splitting hairs on what features matter most to you"></a><strong>Competition: Splitting hairs on what features matter most to you</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Beatit BT-D11:</em></strong> The two units are so similar in their design and production that it really boils down to one question: How important is charging your laptop to you?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Linksys really kicked off the router customization movement in 2002 with its first open source router, the iconic WRT54G. The WRT1900AC followed twelve years later in 2014 and the Linksys WRT3200ACM Router improved upon it in 2016. It introduced the fastest 5GHz band on the market, is Linksys’ first router with Tri-Stream 160, and it’s capable of Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) data streaming and beamforming. This router delivers blazing fast speeds and a number of customized settings with advanced monitoring capabilities you won’t find in a normal router.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40085955&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f702defbc67edb455949f46babab0c18/products/2_logo9.png"                      border="0"                >FX PRO (Gold Robot + Silver Robot(Basic Package))</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xTJh9nKc58L-dK_nTJKAOHW7WCY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4159787_04-d6fd78091be2489c83483672ac57af2e-7c960043bf5f4a259a43c30db125f0f9.jpg"                      alt="Linksys WRTAC3200 Router"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Benjamin Zeman</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.absolute.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4601998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ef70e26a0b5da778eda3f48014d087cd/728x90_larger-shield.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-nostalgic-look"><a href="#Design-A-nostalgic-look" class="headerlink" title="Design: A nostalgic look"></a><strong>Design: A nostalgic look</strong></h2><p> The Linksys WRT3200ACM Router sticks with the familiar black and blue design of its predecessors. At 9.68 x 7.63 x 2.04 inches and 28.16 ounces it’s fairly large, and the four inch antennas add some additional height, though each antenna is adjustable and detachable.</p><p> The front panel has a series of LED status indicators, while the I&#x2F;O and buttons are located around back. The Linksys WRT3200ACM covers all the connectivity bases for us and we appreciate the simplistic front panel LED design.</p><p> We’re divided about the Linksys WRT3200ACM’s aesthetic. On the one hand it’s a pleasant reminder of the past; on the other, it doesn’t blend well into our home decor. In fact, it looks super vintage and really stands out against all our modern tech and furniture. Linksys has released a similar router called the Linksys WRT32X that is geared towards gaming, has basically the same specs, and is all black. From what we can tell, the difference is in the stock software alone, so it may be a better option for blending in. Overall, though, we love the Linksys WRT3200ACM just as much as we loved the WRT54G and WRT1900AC, which is to say a lot.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Simple-or-complex-your-choice"><a href="#Setup-Process-Simple-or-complex-your-choice" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Simple or complex, your choice"></a><strong>Setup Process: Simple or complex, your choice</strong></h2><p> Basic installation of the Linksys WRT3200ACM Router is as easy as any other Linksys router, but if you’re purchasing an open source router, chances are you aren’t looking for basic. With that said, you can still use the included four step Quick Start Guide and get things up and running quickly. Covering our favorite third-party firmwares, OpenWrt and DD-WRT, is beyond the scope of this review, but we had no problems installing either.</p><p> After unpacking the router, we first attached the four antennas and plugged in the power. The front panel display lit up and we connected the included ethernet cable to the yellow internet port on the router and to our modem. We waited until the power light on the front of the router changed from blinking or solid and opened our web browser.</p><p>The Linksys WRT3200ACM performed very well on the 5GHz band.</p><p> Like all other Linksys routers, the WRT3200ACM can be configured using Linksys’ setup wizard by going to<a class="link"   href="http://linksyssmartwifi.com/" >http://LinksysSmartWiFi.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in your favorite web browser. Alternatively, Linksys has a great mobile app on both Android and iOS. We connected to our new network using the network name and password found in both the Quick Start Guide and on the bottom on the router.</p><p> We pulled up the Smart Wi-Fi dashboard in our web browser and the smart wizard walked us through the setup process. If you don’t already have a Linksys Smart Wi-Fi account like we did, you’ll need to create one by entering your email and then clicking the link in the confirmation email. You want to do this while connected to your new network. This associates your new router with your Smart Wi-Fi account.</p><p> At this point you can choose to click the “Manual Configuration” link in the bottom left corner of the setup welcome page or continue with the default setup. After finishing the initial setup, you get access to the dashboard user interface to configure your router at a more in-depth level. The browser interface on the left has a menu with a number of options. We’ll take a look at those options a little later in the software section since they aren’t part of the basic setup process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FS8mMgztL5cutF2feLNI4jorFig=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4159787_03-bc6cced22d1c4e12b578da3f8b644d0c.jpg"                      alt="Linksys WRTAC3200 Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Benjamin Zeman</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-3200ACM-and-MU-MIMO-capable"><a href="#Connectivity-3200ACM-and-MU-MIMO-capable" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: 3200ACM and MU-MIMO capable"></a><strong>Connectivity: 3200ACM and MU-MIMO capable</strong></h2><p> The Linksys WRT3200ACM is a MU-MIMO Dual-Band Tri-Stream 160 router with 600+2600 Mbps speeds. It’s powered by a 1.8GHz dual-core processor and uses the latest 802.11ac network standards. The 2.4GHz band and 5GHz band run independently of each other, so the router can simultaneously reach theoretical speeds of 600 Mbps on 2.4GHz and a massive 2600 Mbps on the 5GHz band.</p><p> Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) capability means the router can efficiently handle bandwidth in homes with devices of different speed grades. It’s essentially like each device has its own router because they connect at their fastest speeds and transmit data simultaneously instead of sequentially. That means you can be running multiple devices throughout the house and each can connect at their highest speed.</p><p> The Linksys WRT3200ACM also has four wired gigabit ethernet ports to directly connect devices like your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >gaming console <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-usb-3-0-2626038" >USB 3.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and USB 2.0&#x2F;eSata ports allow you to connect external storage devices and share things like your video collection across your network. The Linksys WRT3200ACM definitely covered all the connectivity bases that we needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1412049&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-200x200.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Performance-Strong-5-4GHz-but-weak-2-4GHz"><a href="#Network-Performance-Strong-5-4GHz-but-weak-2-4GHz" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Strong 5.4GHz but weak 2.4GHz"></a><strong>Network Performance: Strong 5.4GHz but weak 2.4GHz</strong></h2><p> We tested throughput network performance on a Comcast Business plan, utilizing the 5ft&#x2F;30ft technique, for both 2.4Ghz and 5GHz bands. The Linksys WRT3200ACM performed very well on the 5GHz band and we consistently got an average of 565Mbps at 5ft but a dip to 235Mbps at 30ft. The 2.4GHz band didn’t perform quite as well. We got about 75Mbps at 5ft and only 57Mbps at 20ft.</p><p> We tested coverage across a roughly a 2,000 square foot space and had reliable coverage throughout. We also got decent coverage in the basement, most of our yard, and our parking area. Although the speeds did reduce a lot when we were outside, the connection was still reliable and we were able to do things like pull up a map or watch a YouTube video in HD on our mobile phone while sitting in the car.</p><p> The Linksys WRT3200ACM is also ready for 160MHz-channel-width streaming when compatible clients become more available. For the time being we just consider it future-proofing because there aren’t many compatible devices on the market. Overall, the router has killer performance, decent coverage, and was more than we needed. The 2.4GHz speeds weren’t great but we feel like the 5.4GHz speeds more than make up for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wVmSkbisZVIprvanAm1UGl20r0s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4159787_02-b14c9e4005d248688b03f08126d3f210.jpg"                      alt="Linksys WRTAC3200 Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Benjamin Zeman</p><h2 id="Software-Stock-is-great-open-source-is-better"><a href="#Software-Stock-is-great-open-source-is-better" class="headerlink" title="Software: Stock is great, open source is better"></a><strong>Software: Stock is great, open source is better</strong></h2><p> We’ve said it many times before, Linksys has great stock software. They’ve always been at the forefront when it comes to configuration and advanced settings. The current version of their web browser dashboard and their mobile apps are both great and offer a lot of customization. Everything just works and you won’t run into any frustrations like we did with other companies software.</p><p> Guest Access, Parental Controls and Media Prioritization are all easy to setup and use. You can create up to 50 guest networks and password protect them. With Parental Controls you can set up how much time devices on the network have internet access, our outright restrict and block access for specific devices. Media Prioritization allows you to prioritize devices of your choice by simply dragging them from the normal priority field and dropping them into the high priority section.</p><p> A good buy, though not a necessity if you aren’t looking to utilize it for its open source capabilities.</p><p> There’s also a Speed Test tool to see how fast your upload and download speeds are as you’re tweaking your settings. An External Storage tool allows you to share folders on connected hard drives and set up FTP and Media Servers. Router Settings include Troubleshooting, Connectivity, Wireless, Security, and OpenVPN Server. There’s plenty to explore and we found the router’s stock firmware has everything that the average user would need.</p><p> Flashing Linux based alternatives like<a class="link"   href="https://openwrt.org/" >OpenWrt <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://dd-wrt.com/" >DD-WRT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is simple, and because the router is made with them in mind, firmware will be more stable than<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-routers-4038590" >other routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Currently DD-WRT looks like it is a little behind OpenWrt when it comes to additional features not included in the stock firmware. Both projects are actively working on updates and Linksys does encourage you to go with third-party firmwares, but warns that installing third-party firmware is done at your own risk and will void your warranty.</p><p> If you’re new to open source router firmware, we encourage you to do your research first. Open source firmware is really for users who are familiar with building and debugging their own software. It requires more manual maintenance and you’ll need to keep up with any new releases yourself. There are a lot of other less expensive Linksys routers available if you want to test the waters before jumping in with the WRT3200ACM.</p><h2 id="Price-Good-if-you-need-open-source"><a href="#Price-Good-if-you-need-open-source" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good if you need open source"></a><strong>Price: Good if you need open source</strong></h2><p> The Linksys WRT3200ACM Router typically retails for around $200. Like other Linksys routers, however, you can find massive deals if you are willing to go refurbished. When available, you can find refurb models on Linksys’ own website for $150, and we’ve seen them elsewhere for as low as $100 in the past.</p><p> Even if you don’t go with a refurb, the WRT3200ACM is a good buy, though it’s not a necessity if you aren’t looking to utilize it for its open source capabilities—there are other, cheaper options on the market that will serve your needs just as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Linksys-WRT3200ACM-Router-vs-Asus-RT-AC5300-Router"><a href="#Linksys-WRT3200ACM-Router-vs-Asus-RT-AC5300-Router" class="headerlink" title="Linksys WRT3200ACM Router vs. Asus RT-AC5300 Router"></a><strong>Linksys WRT3200ACM Router vs. Asus RT-AC5300 Router</strong></h2><p> Another router that tends to top the list of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-routers-4038590" >open source routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the Asus RT-AC5300, a Tri-Band AC5300, MU-MIMO-capable router marketed towards gamers. This expensive router has a very large footprint and two antennas on each of the four sides. Its $400 MSRP is significantly higher than the Linksys WRT3200ACM, and the lowest retail price we’ve seen is around $270. Even refurbished, it still goes for $250, the same price as the MSRP of the Linksys WRT3200ACM.</p><p> The Asus RT-AC5300 does boast a massive 5,000 square feet of coverage. It averages around 100 Mbps at close distances and 80 Mbps at 30ft on the 2.4GHz band. It has solid performance on 5GHz with a score of 515 Mbps up close and 320 Mbps at 30ft. Overall, it’s a solid performer with a lot of connectivity options.</p><p> We’re going to cut right to the chase though—we prefer the Linksys. The router may perform well, but ASUS has a reputation for terrible customer service and problems with warranty support, issues we’ve encountered ourselves. The ASUS mobile app is also hugely inferior to the Linksys mobile app. The hardware is powerful but has a higher failure rate than Linksys, and is also visually unappealing.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>One of the best options for open source enthusiasts.</strong></p><p> The Linksys WRT3200ACM Router is a great buy from a great company that’s been in the market for a long time. Whether you purchase the Linksys WRT3200ACM new or refurbished, it’s a fantastic value. The only suggestion we have is that you make sure it’s what you actually want and need—if you aren’t going to use it for its open source capabilities, you might want to take a look at some other options. If open source is your jam, you’ll love this router.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-rt-ac88u-gaming-router-review-4589583" >Asus RT-AC88U Gaming Router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/synology-rt2600ac-wi-fi-router-review-4797390" >Synology RT2600ac Wi-Fi Router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/eero-pro-mesh-wi-fi-system-review-4797008" >Eero Pro Mesh Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  WRT3200ACM Tri-Stream Gigabit Wi-Fi Router</li><li>Product Brand  Linksys</li><li>SKU  WRT3200ACM</li><li>Price  $200.00</li><li>Weight  28.16 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  9.68 x 7.63 x 2.04 in.</li><li>Wi-Fi Technology  AC3200 MU-MIMO Dual-band Gigabit, 600+2600 Mbps</li><li>Network Standards  802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac</li><li>Wi-Fi Speed  AC3200 (N600 + AC2600)</li><li>Wi-Fi Bands  2.4 and 5 GHz (simultaneous dual-band)</li><li>Data Transfer Rate  2.6 Gb per second</li><li>Certified Operating Systems  MacOS (10.X or higher), Windows 7, Windows 8.1 (Works with Windows 10)</li><li>Minimum System Requirements  Internet Explorer® 8 Safari® 5 (for Mac®) Firefox® 8 Google Chrome™</li><li>Number of Antennas  4x external, dual-band, detachable antennas</li><li>Wireless Encryption  WPA2 Personal, WPA2 Enterprise</li><li>Operation Modes  Wireless Router, Access Point, Wired Bridge, Wireless Bridge, Wireless Repeater</li><li>IPv6 Compatible  YES</li><li>Processor  1.8 GHz dual-core</li><li>Range  Very Large Household (square foot coverage not listed)</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The in-car USB charger market is virtually flooded with offerings for virtually any taste to any<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-to-buy-for-under-300-4045957" >budget <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — from the cheap and chintzy to high-tech. The Anker PowerDrive 2 is one of the most popular chargers on the market, and it didn’t disappoint during our testing. In addition to its durable plastic construction, it includes a 3-foot micro<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-micro-usb-cables-4178845" >USB cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a dual-port design, and fast recharge rates for your devices thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology. Don’t let the diminutive blue<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desk-lamps-4135707" >LED light <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> fool you, the Anker PowerDrive 2 can put out enough power to recharge two iPads simultaneously. What’s more, it can do that without<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/problem-with-overheating-laptops-2377646" >overheating <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><h2 id="Design-All-plastic-but-sturdy-and-subtle"><a href="#Design-All-plastic-but-sturdy-and-subtle" class="headerlink" title="Design: All-plastic, but sturdy and subtle"></a><strong>Design: All-plastic, but sturdy and subtle</strong></h2><p> The Anker PowerDrive 2 might not be the sharpest or most cutting-edge looking in-car USB charger, but what it lacks in visual pizazz, it more than makes up for in sturdiness.</p><p> A lot of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-usb-port-not-charging-phone-4102780" >in-car USB chargers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are susceptible to slowly fragmenting. If you yank a USB cable out of the charger haphazardly, the charger might come apart (we encountered this with the RAVPower 24W USB charger). Not so with the Anker PowerDrive 2 which survived weeks of rigorous testing and careless USB cable unpluggings. It’s also fairly compact. It’ll protrude a bit from the 12V port, but it’s not very noticeable.</p><p> Don’t let the diminutive blue LED light fool you, the Anker PowerDrive 2 can put out enough power to recharge two iPads simultaneously.</p><p> That said, it’s not the prettiest charger. The black plastic construction is fine to look at and blends in nicely with most car interiors, but the red ring around the face makes it look a bit cheap. So, too, does the “IQ” logo printed between the two USB ports, but these are fairly minor quibbles. The PowerDrive 2 has a small and unobtrusive LED light to help you find the USB ports in the dark. We found it less distracting than other chargers we tested.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BGmail%2BBackup"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/gmail-backup.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices"><a href="#Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices"></a><strong>Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices</strong></h2><p> The best part of the Anker PowerDrive 2 is its charging. It has the ability to charge iPads simultaneously without getting overheated thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology. Each USB port can output a maximum 5V&#x2F;2.4A, for a total of 24W. That’s in line with other car<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-phone-chargers-4138571" >chargers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we tested, but the PowerIQ technology can help identify device and deliver the fastest possible charge. This also gives you some overvoltage protection to make sure something like a smartwatch doesn’t fry when you plug it in.</p><p> This isn’t quite the same as Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 or other fast charge technologies which vary the voltage and amperage on a larger range, but it’ll top up your phone or other devices faster than a regular charger.</p><p> The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</p><p> One thing to note is that the PowerDrive 2 includes a micro USB cable, in case you don’t want to carry your device’s cable everywhere with you. That’s a nice touch we didn’t get with other chargers we tested.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097466/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097466"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097466"                      border="0" alt="" width="2048" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097466/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Middle-of-the-pack"><a href="#Price-Middle-of-the-pack" class="headerlink" title="Price: Middle of the pack"></a><strong>Price: Middle of the pack</strong></h2><p> The list price of $14.99 is positioned in the mid-range of the USB charger market, which ranges from just a few dollars to upwards of $50 for some fancier chargers. However, Anker PowerDrive 2 can be had for a discounted price on some websites. Considering the fact that the Anker PowerDrive 2 includes both the fast-charger and a 3-foot micro USB cable, it is well priced for the marketplace.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><h2 id="Competition-A-handful-of-rivals"><a href="#Competition-A-handful-of-rivals" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A handful of rivals"></a><strong>Competition: A handful of rivals</strong></h2><p> The RAVPower 24W charger is one of Anker’s main rivals. It has a metal exterior, a lower price tag, and theoretically identical power output. However, its construction is far less robust. In fact, its metal outside easily separates from the internal components easily making Anker a better pick for longevity.</p><p> The Aukey CC-S1 charger is a much closer competitor. It has the standard dual 2.4A USB ports, is constructed from plastic, and costs a few dollars less. One advantage it has is that unlike the PowerDrive, the CC-S1 sits virtually flush to the 12V socket. But you don’t get LED lights, which might make it a hindrance to find at night.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ravpower-24w-usb-car-charger-review-4686799" >RAVPower 24W USB Car Charger Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</strong></p><p> The price is fair, the charging is fast, and the design is unobtrusive.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> As important a job as a jump starter does when it comes to a situation where your vehicle just won’t start, you need a solution that’s reliable yet easy to live with when you don’t need it. The Beatit BT-D11 800A Peak 18000mAh 12V Portable Car Jump Starter contains a lot of power within a small case, and along with its semi-hard case it shows promise to be a great companion to bring along in your vehicle. To see just how well it does the job of resurrecting a non-starting vehicle we drained the battery of a 2011 Hyundai Elantra down to 10V.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Elite.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame"><a href="#Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame" class="headerlink" title="Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame"></a><strong>Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame</strong></h2><p> The Beatit Jump Starter D11’s main unit’s effectively a small black brick with red accents. Roughly the size of a small paperback book, the unit’s constructed out of durable plastic and features a flashlight at one end. Along one of the long sides there’s a small display that shows battery status, the on&#x2F;off switch, two USB power outputs, and the device’s charging port. On the opposing side a rubber flap covers the jumper cable port; a unique port that the jumper cable accessory plugs in to.</p><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case. The clamshell design has two halves that zip together to keep the case closed. One side of the case contains the unit itself within a foam insert, while the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. There’s plenty of room to keep everything involved with the jump starter within its case, and with its shape and relatively small size we found it easy to keep the case in the car.</p><p> Time and again, the Beatit D11 was able to get a car with a very depleted battery started.</p><p> The list of accessories that come with the unit includes both a wall charger and a 12V port charger, a Micro USB cable to charge devices with, and the jumper cables themselves. The jumper cable accessory is a pair of terminal clamps with relatively short cables that together join into a plastic module that plugs into the specific port on the unit. The module has a single status LED on its side that flashes different colors to signify different conditions, such as the unit being ready for jump starting, or indicating incorrect connection of the clamps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453719/17020" target="_top" id="1453719"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453719"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453719/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler"><a href="#Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler"></a><strong>Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler</strong></h2><p> Should you find yourself in a situation where you need to use the jump start functionality of the Beatit Jump Starter D11, you’ll find it quite easy to use. On our Elantra test vehicle we simply had to pop the hood, bring the unit over, and plug the jumper cable accessory into its port. Once in place getting a proper connection is a simple matter of attaching the red clamp to the positive battery terminal and then the black clamp to the negative terminal. With a firm connection in place we simply had to set the unit down someplace where the vibration of the engine wouldn’t make it slide and then start the car. With the unit in place the car immediately started with zero hesitation, at which point we could disconnect the unit and get back on the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> If it’s your other devices that are having some battery issues, the D11’s two USB ports can be used to charge them up. The 2.1A port provides for faster charging, and while the 1A port also works it really doesn’t provide power in a hurry and should only be used with specific devices that can’t handle the other port’s amperage. For most modern phones you’re just going to want to plug it into the 2.1A port and enjoy the faster recharge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901369&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix 4K - Software based live production. vMix 4K includes everything in vMix HD plus 4K support, PTZ control, External&#x2F;Fullscreen output, 4 Virtual Outputs, 1 Replay, 4 vMix Call, and 2 Recorders.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs"><a href="#Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs"></a><strong>Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs</strong></h2><p> Time and again, the Beatit Jump Starter D11 was able to get a car with a very<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-batteries-are-made-to-die-534765" >depleted battery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> started. Even after repeated testing the unit’s own battery only dropped down to 85% capacity.</p><p> Charging a phone with a jump starter seems like overkill, and the unit’s ability to charge at 1,200mAh confirms that impression. At such an elevated level of charging your phone or other device will likely get its battery topped off in very little time. With 18,000mAh of capacity you can fully charge a modern phone at least twice, and still leave the unit with the juice it needs in order to start a car.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight"><a href="#Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight"></a><strong>Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight</strong></h2><p> There aren’t a ton of other features present with the Beatit Jump Starter D11 but there are some of note, including the unit’s built-in flashlight. It’s a nice addition to have if you must jump start a car in the middle of the night, but it doesn’t put out of a ton of light and the beam is pretty narrow. You can pick the unit up and use it as a large flashlight, though doing so while also trying to get the clamps attached is cumbersome.</p><p> A nice feature that is present in many jump starters but always appreciated is the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V port charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lets you charge the unit back up within the car once you have it started. Charging from the wall charger is faster overall, but people with a dodgy battery but a working alternator will appreciate being able to use the jump starter to get their car started and then charge the unit back up as they drive to their destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=11224199&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/copy_boxshot_lyricvideo.png"                      border="0"                >Lyric Video Creator Professional Version</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost"><a href="#Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost" class="headerlink" title="Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost"></a><strong>Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost</strong></h2><p> The MSRP of the Beatit Jump Starter D11 is $70 which makes it one of the most affordable jump starters on the market. Indeed, at that price, it’s the least expensive one we tested, yet no part of it feels like any corners were cut in terms of quality or performance.</p><p> At that price point, it packs a ton of value into its diminutive size.</p><h2 id="Competition-In-the-battle-of-the-smallest-this-one-reigns-supreme"><a href="#Competition-In-the-battle-of-the-smallest-this-one-reigns-supreme" class="headerlink" title="Competition: In the battle of the smallest, this one reigns supreme"></a><strong>Competition: In the battle of the smallest, this one reigns supreme</strong></h2><p><strong><em>DBPOWER 600A Peak 18000mAh Portable Car Jump Starter:</em></strong>  When it comes down to it these two units are surprisingly similar, down to the case and overall design of the unit. If you really want the ability to use your jump starter to also charge your laptop the DBPOWER is worth a look. Otherwise, save yourself around $10 and stick with the Beatit BT-D11.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dbpower-djs50-jump-starter-review-4783966" >DBPOWER Portable Car Jump Starter Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong><em>M MOOCK 1000A Peak 18000mAh Car Jump Starter:</em></strong>  This is another case of asking yourself how much you need the option to charge a laptop. The M MOOCK jump starter can but is also roughly $8 more. Its case is more of a flat square as well, so it slides more easily under seats. It’s a toss-up here, but the Beatit BT-D11 is a slightly better choice overall.</p><p> To read more reviews, check out our roundup of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-portable-jump-starters-4140286" >best portable jump starters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>For the price, it’s perfect.</strong></p><p> In a crowded field, there are few units that are as easy to recommend as the Beatit BT-D11 800A Peak 18000mAh 12V Portable Car Jump Starter. It has relatively few features when compared to some of its competitors but otherwise excels at what it’s designed to do.

It isn’t anything special to look at, but that’s to be expected from a budget line like Insignia. The good thing is that it’s fairly light, at less than 20 pounds, and the large feet make it quite steady.</p><p> Most of the ports are found on the left side of the set, as you face it, with a few of them oriented downward instead.</p><p> The power button is situated in a semi-translucent plastic bulge near one of the feet, making it easy to locate, and you can use the same button to switch inputs. There are no other physical buttons on this set, so don’t lose the remote.</p><p> When watching shows on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and HBO Now, dialogue came through crystal clear, and sound effects had enough substance that we didn’t feel the need to immediately plug in a soundbar or reach for our Bluetooth headphones.</p><p> This television uses a standard detachable C7 power cord instead of a hard-wired power cable, and it features a standard 200 x 200 millimeter<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tv-wall-mounts-3276137" >VESA mount <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to ditch the clunky feet and hang it on a wall.</p><p> While this set does have Alexa built right in, it works like a Fire TV Stick and not like a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-cube-4172274" >Fire TV Cube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-amazon-echo-4147189" >Echo device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . What that means is it lacks far-field microphones, so you have to give commands via the remote. The remote itself is the same basic design that’s included with other Fire TV devices, but it includes volume buttons, a live TV button, and preset shortcuts for a few streaming services.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8ovvGrqb8Me9IvWHrQc7UW02kw8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-4-acb78e6d55e4488ca394495d5c74c754.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-Phillips-screwdriver-and-your-Amazon-password"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-Phillips-screwdriver-and-your-Amazon-password" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a Phillips screwdriver and your Amazon password"></a><strong>Setup Process: You’ll need a Phillips screwdriver and your Amazon password</strong></h2><p> Despite being a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-43-inch-tvs-4588664" >43-inch class television <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is light enough for most people to handle and set up without any outside assistance. It’s even packed in a bag that has convenient handles, making it easy to lift up and out of the box and set carefully on a table for assembly.</p><p> This television comes more or less ready to go, but the feet have to be attached if you aren’t going to wall mount it. The feet are clearly marked as to which side needs to point toward the front of the television, and each one attaches with two Phillips screws. If you have a Phillips screwdriver at hand, you can have everything tightened up and the television standing up within a couple minutes.</p><p> Despite being a 43-inch class television, the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is light enough for most people to handle and set up without any outside assistance.</p><p> Once the feet are on, or the television has been hung on a wall mount, it’s time to turn it on. This presents you with the Fire TV interface, so you should be ready to pick your favorite apps, connect to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430" >Wi-Fi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or wired network, and then log into your Amazon account if you want to get the most out of your new television. There’s also a basic mode if you don’t have an Amazon account or just don’t want to log in.</p><p> The final part of the setup process involves waiting for your apps to download, and then allowing the Fire TV to download and install a firmware update. None of this is too terribly time consuming, but plan on setting aside at least 10 to 15 minutes before your TV is fully ready to watch.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crystal-clear-and-beautiful-colors-but-HDR-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crystal-clear-and-beautiful-colors-but-HDR-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crystal clear and beautiful colors, but HDR leaves a bit to be desired"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crystal clear and beautiful colors, but HDR leaves a bit to be desired</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is a 4K UHD television with HDR support, and the picture quality is a massive improvement over lower resolution (1080p, 720p) televisions, especially if you have hardware or media that’s capable of taking advantage of the increased resolution. Game consoles like the 4K-capable Xbox One X and PS4 Pro look great, as do UHD Blu-rays.</p><p> We also loaded up Amazon Prime Video, which includes a bunch of 4K content if you don’t have any UHD devices. Watching an episode of The Tick, Peter Serafinowicz’s bright blue suit popped against the comparatively drab cityscape, and the action was clear and crisp as he bounded from building to building.</p><p> Viewing angles on our test unit were great, with a bit of noticeable color or brightness variation when viewing from up close and at extreme angles.</p><p> Colors look great across all kinds of different content, but the contrast isn’t as good. Dark scenes seem a bit muddy, with areas that should be perfect black being lighter than they really should be.</p><p> While this set does have UHD support, it’s limited to HDR10 and doesn’t support local dimming. That means the HDR isn’t as effective as you’ll see in more expensive televisions, but it’s still great for a budget TV like this.</p><p> Viewing angles on our test unit were great, with a bit of noticeable color or brightness variation when viewing from up close and at extreme angles. When backed up to a more appropriate distance, we didn’t have any problem viewing this television from any seat in the house.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Surprisingly-good-for-a-budget-set"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Surprisingly-good-for-a-budget-set" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Surprisingly good for a budget set"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Surprisingly good for a budget set</strong></h2><p> Built-in television speakers usually aren’t very good, which is why soundbars are popular. That’s especially true of budget television sets, but the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 actually has decent audio quality. You’ll probably want to invest in a soundbar if you don’t already have one, but the sound quality is good enough that you can get by with the built-in speakers if you need to.</p><p> When watching shows on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and HBO Now, dialogue came through crystal clear, and sound effects had enough substance that we didn’t feel the need to immediately plug in a soundbar or reach for our Bluetooth headphones. We also loaded up Amazon Music, turned the volume up, and found that the speakers were loud enough to fill the room without any noticeable distortion. The speakers are definitely lacking in bass, but it’s still surprisingly good for a budget television.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OfRGDj7hZY6nrkoT_HqDEM1S9Ts=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-2-8b38ffeb5ce44c0d9a6c7aa7f6dce4cd.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Ports-Full-complement-of-digital-and-analog-inputs-and-outputs"><a href="#Ports-Full-complement-of-digital-and-analog-inputs-and-outputs" class="headerlink" title="Ports: Full complement of digital and analog inputs and outputs"></a><strong>Ports: Full complement of digital and analog inputs and outputs</strong></h2><p> The ports are split, with some on the left side of the television as you face it, and others exiting toward the bottom.</p><p> On the left side, you’ll find a headphone jack, USB port, and two HDMI ports. The first HDMI port is also ARC capable, which means you can use it to feed audio signals to a compatible soundbar without requiring a separate audio cable.</p><p> On the bottom, you’ll find an ethernet port, digital optical output, RCA jacks for analog video and audio inputs, a coaxial connector for your antenna or cable box, and a third HDMI port.</p><p> All of the ports are well clear of the VESA mount, so you shouldn’t lose access to them if you opt to mount the set on a wall. The exception is that if you use a flush mount, you’ll have trouble reaching the down-facing bank of ports due to the way that the chassis of the television bulges out at the bottom.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2337838&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzZwphIv4RM" title="APFill - Ink and Toner Coverage Calculator" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/V97gOTfZ6Zys4aZv9gzGupbwRi8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-3-b8a8cb21803f40ada92bf08de6ee6fc0.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Built-in-Fire-TV-with-Alexa-voice-controls-is-snappy-and-responsive"><a href="#Software-Built-in-Fire-TV-with-Alexa-voice-controls-is-snappy-and-responsive" class="headerlink" title="Software: Built-in Fire TV with Alexa voice controls is snappy and responsive"></a><strong>Software: Built-in Fire TV with Alexa voice controls is snappy and responsive</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is the Fire TV edition of this hardware. It also comes in a slightly different configuration that’s built on the Roku platform instead, but this one has Fire TV baked in with no option to switch.</p><p> As a Fire TV, this television is excellent. It runs just as well as our Fire TV Cube, and the menus and apps load faster than they do on our Fire TV Sticks. If you primarily use your television for streaming through apps like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube, then you won’t have any problems with this television.</p><p> It runs just as well as our Fire TV Cube, and the menus and apps load faster than they do on our Fire TV Sticks.</p><p> We also tested out the Alexa voice command implementation and found that it works very well. Even with two other Alexa devices in earshot, including a Fire TV Cube, the Insignia’s voice remote picked up and executed our commands flawlessly.</p><p> If you watch a lot of broadcast television or have a cable box, the Fire TV interface can be a bit more frustrating. The main issue is that the Fire TV remote just isn’t built with regular television use in mind, as it lacks a numeric keypad.</p><p> You can ask Alexa to tune to specific channels, and the Fire TV interface has a section for over the air television channels, but the implementation is a little clumsy in its current incarnation.</p><h2 id="Price-Right-in-line-with-other-43-inch-class-smart-TVs"><a href="#Price-Right-in-line-with-other-43-inch-class-smart-TVs" class="headerlink" title="Price: Right in line with other 43-inch class smart TVs"></a><strong>Price: Right in line with other 43-inch class smart TVs</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 has an MSRP of $299.99, but it’s typically available for around $249.99. Priced at around $249.99, it’s right in the general neighborhood of other 43-inch class smart televisions, including other Fire TVs, sets built around Roku, and others with proprietary systems. There are a lot of decent options in the general $200 to $250 range, but this one is the best of the bunch if you’re firmly entrenched in Amazon’s ecosystem.</p><h2 id="Competition-Beats-out-other-Fire-TV-models"><a href="#Competition-Beats-out-other-Fire-TV-models" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Beats out other Fire TV models"></a><strong>Competition: Beats out other Fire TV models</strong></h2><p> Compared to previous 43-inch class televisions built on the Fire TV platform, the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is the clear winner. For example, the Toshiba 43LF421U19 is a 43-inch class set that’s also built on the Fire TV platform, and sells for about $299.99, but it’s worse than the Insignia in almost every category. It isn’t 4K or HDR-capable, the viewing angles are worse, colors aren’t as good, and the built-in Fire TV is sluggish compared to the Insignia unit that we tested.</p><p> Toshiba’s 43LF621U19 Fire TV Edition is a 4K UHD television that comes closer to matching the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19, with an MSRP of $329.99, a similar set of ports, and a basic mode that doesn’t require an Amazon account. It also has worse contrast and color range, so the Insignia is still our recommendation of the two.</p><p> If you aren’t specifically focused on Fire TV, the TCL 43S517 is a decent alternative to this set. It’s a 43-inch class smart TV that’s built on the Roku platform instead of Fire TV, and it works a bit better is a regular television, with cable and over the air broadcasts, than the Insignia. It also has ever so slightly better color reproduction. It does have a higher MSRP of $499, but it’s typically available for around $240 to $260.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>This is the budget Fire TV to own if you can’t step up to a larger model.</strong></p><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 isn’t perfect, but it’s probably as close as you’ll get at this price point. This is definitely the UHD TV to own in the 43-inch class if you’re deep in the Amazon ecosystem and really want to go with Fire TV as your smart TV platform. It has great color reproduction, excellent viewing angles, and even decent sound from the onboard stereo speakers.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  NS-43DF710NA19 43” 4K Fire TV</li><li>Product Brand  Insignia</li><li>UPC  600603233920</li><li>Price  $300.00</li><li>Release Date  September 2018</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.9 x 38.2 x 24.3 in.</li><li>Warranty  One year limited</li><li>Compatibility  Alexa, Fire TV</li><li>Platform  Fire TV</li><li>Screen Size  42.5 inches</li><li>Screen Resolution  2160p (4K)</li><li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)  Yes</li><li>Refresh Rate  60Hz</li><li>Maximum Contrast Ratio  4000:1</li><li>Ports  3x HDMI, USB, Digital Optical Audio Output, RCA Audio Output, Composite Video Input, RF Antenna Input, Headphone Jack, Ethernet</li><li>Speakers  Stereo 8-watt speakers</li><li>Connectivity Options  Wi-Fi, Ethernet</li><li>Mount Included  No</li><li>Stand Included  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Contrary to some other options, this case is easy to put on and take off, fitting much like a second skin.

I tested the TP-Link Archer C80 for a week to see if its design, connectivity, network performance, range, and software make the device a worthwhile investment when compared to other budget routers on the market.</p><h2 id="Design-Basic-but-effective"><a href="#Design-Basic-but-effective" class="headerlink" title="Design: Basic, but effective"></a><strong>Design: Basic, but effective</strong></h2><p> The Archer C80 is an exceptionally small router, with a body that measures only 4.6 inches tall, 8.5 inches wide, and 1.26 inches in depth. Since its body is smaller than a paperback book, the router can sit inconspicuously on a table or desk. It also has two keyhole mounts on the back for mounting on a wall.</p><p> The matte black color scheme allows it to blend in with other devices, so you’ll barely notice it on a desk or workstation. The surface is textured, with recesses to hide the venting. The texturing is both a blessing and a curse because it causes the C80 to collect a little extra dust, but it also hides fingerprints and smudges.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ep4Dk2l5q44AgM0S3cs9My3AE3M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TP-Link_Archer_C80_03-a367c45b39474785856cb986e82c88dc.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer C80"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> Overall, the C80 feels pretty sturdy. There are four antennas, and they don’t feel flimsy or easily breakable. The antennas are exceptionally long—disproportionately so when compared to the router’s body—but the length of the antennas is advantageous for performance. You can move the antennas 90 degrees up and down and roughly 180 degrees side to side, which lets you appropriately adjust them for placement on a wall or table. The Gigabit Ethernet ports (one WAN, four LAN) and power adapter port are located on the back of the device, which is ideal for placement on a flat surface, but not as great for mounting on a wall because the cables come out of the top of the router, and they’re difficult to hide or organize.</p><p> The antennas are exceptionally long—disproportionately so when compared to the router’s body—but the length of the antennas is advantageous for performance.</p><p> With the Archer C80, you’re giving up a few features in exchange for speed. This is a dual-band<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/802-11ac-in-wireless-networking-818284" >AC1900 router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , meaning it can reach up to 1300 Mbps on the 5 GHz band and up to 600 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band for a total of 1900 Mbps, so it’s not as theoretically fast as a Wi-Fi 6 router. However, this is still one of the faster routers I’ve tested in this price range.</p><p> The C80 doesn’t have a USB port, which was quite a disappointment. USB ports are becoming more commonplace in Wi-Fi routers, as people like to have a USB port for easy sharing of hard drives and printers across the network. The C80 also lacks Alexa compatibility, a third band, or an ultra-high performance processor.</p><p> On the bright side, the C80 has beamforming, which promotes a more concentrated signal and a longer range. It has 3 x 3 MU-MIMO technology, which means it can transmit and receive three data streams simultaneously. This helps the router provide a faster signal when you’re watching shows, gaming, or using a 3 x 3 capable computer. It has smart connect, which makes it possible for your router to switch devices between bands, and airtime fairness, which helps reduce lag caused by older or slower devices by distributing airtime more equally. This way, a slow device is less likely to bog down the network.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713321&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVDJ1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV DJ Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tXeiVJNqjtwMg97as87xxtsMwhc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TP-Link_Archer_C80_04-375b5f92ce9d44f4af109c8f6bfada16.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer C80"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4712430&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c404a5adbf90e09631678b13b05d9d7a/products/dlnow_256.png"                      border="0"                >DLNow Video Downloader</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Performance-Fast-speeds-No-USB-port"><a href="#Network-Performance-Fast-speeds-No-USB-port" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Fast speeds, No USB port"></a><strong>Network Performance: Fast speeds, No USB port</strong></h2><p> Although this is a low to mid-tier level device, I was quite impressed with its speed and performance. I live in a suburb about 20 minutes away from Raleigh, NC, and I have Spectrum as my internet service provider. The Wi-Fi speeds in my home max out at 400 Mbps. I have a smart box that sits in a utility closet where the router connects. I mounted the router on the wall in that closet, which has a solid door that acts as an immediate signal obstruction. In spite of the presence of this solid door, I was still able to get between 340 and 350 Mbps all throughout the entire downstairs (on the 5GHz band). On the 2.4GHz band, I could get up to 90Mbps all throughout the first floor and in my garage.</p><p> When I loaded up the network with several of the devices in my home—more than 30 smart home products, gaming PCs, laptops, consoles, streaming devices, smart TVs, and phones—I started to experience a noticeable slowdown. This is not the best router for gaming or for those who use multiple connected devices simultaneously. The C80 would be ideal for homes with light to moderate networking demands.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048972/16384" target="_top" id="2048972"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048972"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048972/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_Q5QoisOd-Mv52nqHoV1nGzgcAU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TP-Link_Archer_C80_05-9d8e4d6e12094157a7083463ee3c3ca4.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer C80"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Range-Even-better-than-advertised"><a href="#Range-Even-better-than-advertised" class="headerlink" title="Range: Even better than advertised"></a><strong>Range: Even better than advertised</strong></h2><p> TP-Link advertises the C80 as a router for three-bedroom homes. However, that estimate understates the router’s range capabilities. My home is a two-story, 3,000 square-foot residence with five-bedrooms, and I was able to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection in every corner. Every closet, bathroom, and bedroom got a steady signal, and I experienced no dead zones whatsoever. Even in the garage, front yard, and backyard, the signal remained strong. It was only when I attempted to use multiple gaming and streaming devices at one time that I experienced any sort of lag.</p><p> Every closet, bathroom, and bedroom maintained a signal, and I experienced no dead zones whatsoever.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://cowinaudio.pxf.io/c/5597632/1116855/13794" target="_top" id="1116855"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13794-1116855"                      border="0" alt="" width="767" height="285"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1116855/13794"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-TP-Link-Tether-app"><a href="#Software-TP-Link-Tether-app" class="headerlink" title="Software: TP-Link Tether app"></a><strong>Software: TP-Link Tether app</strong></h2><p> The C80 is a cinch to set up in less than five minutes, with guest networks created and all. The TP-Link Tether app is one of my favorite router companion apps. The interface is super clean, and you can see exactly what devices are on each of your network bands. You can even have the app alert you when a new device signs into your network.</p><p> You can set up parental controls, where you create a profile for individual family members, block content, and set time limits indicating how long certain devices are allowed on the Wi-Fi network. This allows me to control my kid’s PlayStation time right in the Tether app, as well as control screen time on other devices in the home.</p><p> If you want to control more advanced features, like NAT forwarding, DHCP servers, and IPv6, you’ll need to use the web management tool. The web management tool also provides more extensive parental control features, letting you filter out content by keywords (instead of just blocking websites). The web tool has a user-friendly interface, but it’s not as convenient as using the Tether app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/K7t4mxXXwGR4rJTa20ITT7J74sk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TP-Link_Archer_C80_Tether_App_02-e29468aacf8f426981080a8914426619.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer C80"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Around-100-bucks"><a href="#Price-Around-100-bucks" class="headerlink" title="Price: Around 100 bucks"></a><strong>Price: Around 100 bucks</strong></h2><p> The TP-Link Archer C80 sells for $100, which is a reasonable price for the unit considering it offers fast speeds, dual-band connectivity, and technologies like MU-MIMO to enhance performance.</p><h2 id="TP-Link-Archer-C80-vs-TP-Link-Archer-A9"><a href="#TP-Link-Archer-C80-vs-TP-Link-Archer-A9" class="headerlink" title="TP-Link Archer C80 vs. TP-Link Archer A9"></a><strong>TP-Link Archer C80 vs. TP-Link Archer A9</strong></h2><p> The Archer A9 is another affordable offering from TP-Link, with a price tag of under $100.

I recently tested the A9 as well. The A9 offers more in the way of features, but I was able to get faster speeds and better coverage out of the C80. If you want a router that offers a more comprehensive experience, go with the A9. If you just want an affordable, speedy router that will maintain a signal at long range, you’ll probably be happy with the C80.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Fast speeds and an exceptionally long range.</strong></p><p> Even though it lacks a USB port, the Archer C80 puts out impressive speeds over a long range in homes with light to medium networking capacity. For homes that have several people streaming, gaming, and working on cloud applications, they’ll want something more high octane.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Archer C80 AC1900 Wireless MU-MIMO Wi-Fi 5 Router</li><li>Product Brand  TP-Link</li><li>UPC  845973088873</li><li>Price  $100.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.5 x 4.6 x 1.26 in.</li><li>Warranty  2 years</li><li>Security  SPI Firewall, Access Control, IP &amp; MAC Binding, Application Layer Gateway, Wi-Fi Encryption (WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA&#x2F;WPA2-Enterprise (802.1x))</li><li>IPv6 Compatible  Yes</li><li>MU-MIMO  Yes, 3 x 3</li><li>Number of Atennas  4</li><li>Number of Bands  Dual</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  5</li><li>Modes  Router Mode, Access Point Mode</li><li>Processor  1.2 GHz CPU</li><li>Range  3-bedroom houses</li><li>Wi-Fi Capacity  Medium</li><li>Parental Controls  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

If you yank a USB cable out of the charger haphazardly, the charger might come apart (we encountered this with the RAVPower 24W USB charger). Not so with the Anker PowerDrive 2 which survived weeks of rigorous testing and careless USB cable unpluggings. It’s also fairly compact. It’ll protrude a bit from the 12V port, but it’s not very noticeable.</p><p> Don’t let the diminutive blue LED light fool you, the Anker PowerDrive 2 can put out enough power to recharge two iPads simultaneously.</p><p> That said, it’s not the prettiest charger. The black plastic construction is fine to look at and blends in nicely with most car interiors, but the red ring around the face makes it look a bit cheap. So, too, does the “IQ” logo printed between the two USB ports, but these are fairly minor quibbles. The PowerDrive 2 has a small and unobtrusive LED light to help you find the USB ports in the dark. We found it less distracting than other chargers we tested.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=33729450&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices"><a href="#Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices"></a><strong>Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices</strong></h2><p> The best part of the Anker PowerDrive 2 is its charging. It has the ability to charge iPads simultaneously without getting overheated thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology. Each USB port can output a maximum 5V&#x2F;2.4A, for a total of 24W. That’s in line with other car<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-phone-chargers-4138571" >chargers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we tested, but the PowerIQ technology can help identify device and deliver the fastest possible charge. This also gives you some overvoltage protection to make sure something like a smartwatch doesn’t fry when you plug it in.</p><p> This isn’t quite the same as Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 or other fast charge technologies which vary the voltage and amperage on a larger range, but it’ll top up your phone or other devices faster than a regular charger.</p><p> The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</p><p> One thing to note is that the PowerDrive 2 includes a micro USB cable, in case you don’t want to carry your device’s cable everywhere with you. That’s a nice touch we didn’t get with other chargers we tested.</p><h2 id="Price-Middle-of-the-pack"><a href="#Price-Middle-of-the-pack" class="headerlink" title="Price: Middle of the pack"></a><strong>Price: Middle of the pack</strong></h2><p> The list price of $14.99 is positioned in the mid-range of the USB charger market, which ranges from just a few dollars to upwards of $50 for some fancier chargers. However, Anker PowerDrive 2 can be had for a discounted price on some websites. Considering the fact that the Anker PowerDrive 2 includes both the fast-charger and a 3-foot micro USB cable, it is well priced for the marketplace.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4728277&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/1_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-A-handful-of-rivals"><a href="#Competition-A-handful-of-rivals" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A handful of rivals"></a><strong>Competition: A handful of rivals</strong></h2><p> The RAVPower 24W charger is one of Anker’s main rivals. It has a metal exterior, a lower price tag, and theoretically identical power output. However, its construction is far less robust. In fact, its metal outside easily separates from the internal components easily making Anker a better pick for longevity.</p><p> The Aukey CC-S1 charger is a much closer competitor. It has the standard dual 2.4A USB ports, is constructed from plastic, and costs a few dollars less. One advantage it has is that unlike the PowerDrive, the CC-S1 sits virtually flush to the 12V socket. But you don’t get LED lights, which might make it a hindrance to find at night.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ravpower-24w-usb-car-charger-review-4686799" >RAVPower 24W USB Car Charger Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</strong></p><p> The price is fair, the charging is fast, and the design is unobtrusive.

But it’s not all the stuff that makes Minecraft one of the world’s most popular games—it’s the game itself.</p><p> Even a decade after its original alpha release, Minecraft remains a pure and compelling sandbox experience, dropping players into a blocky world full of seemingly endless possibilities. It has no storyline, no missions, and no obvious hooks to pull you into the game. It’s essentially a blank canvas—a blocky, pixelated blank canvas. But the beauty of Minecraft is that not only is there so much more going on beneath the surface (literally, too), but the freeform design enables new and diverse kinds of play and is especially great for younger players.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4694919&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

While there are hundreds of items to discover, craft, and use, as well as various creatures to interact with, Minecraft never complicates the way that you actually interact with each randomly-generated game world.</p><p> As a blocky hero, you’ll explore the likewise blocky world by using the analog stick on your control, keys on your keyboard, or digital directional pad on your screen—depending on which device you’re playing on. You can jump, destroy blocks and items (mine), place blocks and items, and use menus to manage your inventory and use the crafting interface. It’s not a whole lot, and while there are some other minor game mechanics that pop up along the way, it’s amazing to see a five- or six-year-old grab the controller and quickly get comfortable.</p><p> My six-year-old son has become obsessed not only with playing Minecraft and experimenting within, but also reading about the ecosystem in books and gaining ideas for his next session.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-minecraft-2363311" >Minecraft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> splits its experience into two core modes: Survival and Creative. Survival is the closest thing there is to an “adventure,” although it’s still pretty unstructured. You start with essentially nothing in Survival, which means it’s up to you to make the most of your surroundings. You’ll need to mine materials from trees and earth, build a shelter to protect yourself from the enemies that come out at night, and eventually assemble a crafting table to unlock many more possibilities. You have a wellness bar and are bound by gravity, so it’s about as close to a simulation as Minecraft gets.</p><p> Creative mode, on the other hand, removes the shackles. You have access to every single item available in the game, plus you can float through the air at will. With no life bar and no fear of peril, this is the mode for experimenting with the game’s many, many resources, as well as the mode for crafting massive, elaborate structures. Both modes offer a very different slice of Minecraft, and you might find yourself gravitating towards one or the other.</p><p> Some players will undoubtedly find Minecraft to be aimless, or even pointless. Without the kind of structure and deliberate nudges built into most other games, anyone expecting the Minecraft to do the work for them might be sorely disappointed. But for those who embrace the freeform nature of the experience, this pure sandbox affair can be deeply captivating. And the myriad nuances of the world and its creatures and items are likewise compelling. My six-year-old son has become obsessed not only with playing Minecraft and experimenting within, but also reading about the ecosystem in books and gaining ideas for his next session. It almost becomes a mindset more than just a game, but at least it’s one you can feel comfortable with.</p><p> Minecraft also has a significant multiplayer and modding component. Players can connect online to play together in both the Creative and Survival modes, or even connect to dedicated servers via the premium Minecraft Realms service. Realms charges a monthly fee, but lets you share an ongoing game world with friends far and wide. Both ways are also a great opportunity for parents and children to play together, plus the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch versions of Minecraft offer split-screen local multiplayer.</p><p> Minecraft remains such a pure and compelling sandbox experience, dropping players into a blocky world full of seemingly endless possibilities.</p><p> The PC, Xbox One, Switch, and mobile versions of Minecraft all feature a built-in Marketplace, where you can download character skins and community-made game modes. There are officially-licensed content packs based on the likes of Toy Story and Adventure Time, as well as mini-games and unique play modes to download and enjoy. Some of these features are free, while others require you to purchase in-game Minecraft Coins to access them. Sadly, the Marketplace isn’t available on PlayStation 4 due to Sony’s restrictions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KZOlKmF7mtow8s24LyCEegfMQeA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Minecraft-Playstation-4-Video-Game-4-4fa0600f16e3489686b18da7be164b82.jpg"                      alt="Minecraft"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Graphics-All-block-everything"><a href="#Graphics-All-block-everything" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: All block everything"></a><strong>Graphics: All block everything</strong></h2><p> It’s all chunky and fuzzy in Minecraft, which uses a voxel-based system that makes everything look like giant 3D pixels. Even human characters and animals are boxy-looking, but that’s part of the lo-fi charm of the game. The Minecraft look has become iconic over the last 10 years, and influenced an untold number of other games since. There are visual modifications available that smooth out the graphics or apply lifelike textures, but the core look is decidedly Minecraft.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vtgr1TMhJGVqcjBzkQXrnRqhUsY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Minecraft-Playstation-4-Video-Game-6-0ca6fe5018cf465caed86f1b81ef3e36.jpg"                      alt="Minecraft"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Kid-Appropriate-They-play-it-in-schools-seriously"><a href="#Kid-Appropriate-They-play-it-in-schools-seriously" class="headerlink" title="Kid Appropriate: They play it in schools (seriously)"></a><strong>Kid Appropriate: They play it in schools (seriously)</strong></h2><p> Minecraft is rated Everyone 10+ by the ESRB. You can craft and wield weapons such as swords, axes, and a bow and arrow, and use them to slay beasts such as zombies and the explosive Creeper, as well as attack and kill animals like pigs and wolves. You can also set animals and creatures on fire. However, it’s all presented in the same kind of goofy, pixel-stylized design and isn’t graphic or realistic at all. Escaping enemies in the nighttime can be intense, however, so younger players might do better with Creative mode or by staying inside of a shelter all night in Survival mode.</p><p> Teachers have customized and designed Minecraft worlds and scenarios that help deliver interactive lessons in history, science, math, and more.</p><p> How kid-appropriate is Minecraft? Appropriate enough for Microsoft to have designed an Education Edition of the game that is used for a wide array of subjects in classrooms around the world. Teachers have customized and designed Minecraft worlds and scenarios that help deliver interactive lessons in history, science, math, and more. Yes, it’s entirely possible that your kid’s experience playing Minecraft will come in handy at school—and also likely that Minecraft can help get your kid excited about a typically-rote subject.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033095&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced-3YR.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0-VNwmWbUKQwP5ADxnWHIOr9zwQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Minecraft-Playstation-4-Video-Game-2-e2c20e8d4ac643a8afd8d37093a369cd.jpg"                      alt="Minecraft"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1853659/21526" target="_top" id="1853659"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-1853659"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="750"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1853659/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-fantastic-deal"><a href="#Price-A-fantastic-deal" class="headerlink" title="Price: A fantastic deal"></a><strong>Price: A fantastic deal</strong></h2><p> Minecraft is an excellent value at $20 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions of the game, and just $7 for the iOS and Android editions. That’s a steal for a game that players could potentially pour hundreds or thousands of hours into. The in-game Marketplace purchases might seem a bit pricey by comparison, with some content packs and new modes selling for the equivalent of $5+ apiece, but it could be a small price to pay to help keep an already-cheap game fresh for longer.</p><h2 id="Minecraft-vs-LEGO-Worlds"><a href="#Minecraft-vs-LEGO-Worlds" class="headerlink" title="Minecraft vs. LEGO Worlds"></a><strong>Minecraft vs. LEGO Worlds</strong></h2><p> Minecraft has been described as many as modern-day or digital LEGOs although there actually are licensed LEGO Minecraft building kits out there. However, in the gaming world, LEGO tried to capitalize on the Minecraft phenomenon by making its own creative building game called<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lego-dimensions-review-4686589" >LEGO Worlds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Released in 2017, LEGO Worlds does things a bit differently, with a hilarious narrator giving cues and little LEGO minifigure characters doling out missions. We really liked the game’s unique, LEGO-built worlds and wide array of building possibilities, however, the building controls aren’t nearly as intuitive as in Minecraft, plus it turns repetitive faster. LEGO Worlds also hasn’t caught on to nearly the same extent as Minecraft, which remains a bona fide sensation today. Chances are much better that your friends are playing Minecraft than LEGO Worlds.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lego-dimensions-review-4686589" >LEGO Dimensions Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A modern classic.</strong></p><p> Even a decade after release, Minecraft is an essential gaming experience for players of all ages, and especially for younger gamers. The sandbox design means that players can drop in and concoct their own experiences in each randomly-generated world, and the way it hooks in kids via good, old-fashioned creativity and experimentation is a sight to behold. Minecraft’s open-ended design won’t be for everyone—but it’s something truly special for those who embrace it.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Minecraft</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>Price  $19.99</li><li>Release Date  October 2011</li><li>Platforms  Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox One, Windows PC, iOS, Android</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
