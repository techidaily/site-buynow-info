Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk is a powerful gaming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >desktop PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a surprisingly decent value to those that lack the time or ability to build a gaming desktop from scratch. I say this, reluctantly, as someone who has spent his entire life building gaming desktops by hand, not to mention countless video editing workstations for coworkers at the various places I’ve been employed. All this to say that I’m an advocate for building your own PC, but I still believe the OMEN is a pretty good value for a lot of people.</p><p> As configured, our HP OMEN Obelisk came equipped with Intel’s 9th gen i9-9900K and Nvidia’s GTX 2080 Super, a top-tier combination that makes light work of just about any game you might throw its way. All this comes at a cost for this tiny enclosure, however, and the components get very hot under load. The i9-9900k is an absolute furnace of a CPU to begin with, and the single 120mm AIO water cooler can only do so much.</p><p> How has HP reconciled all these things, and what does it mean for potential owners? Let’s take a look at the performance, build quality, and usability of this space-conscious gaming desktop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OXMiCXvzh8P7esVvbjPoSorzoxM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-2-7b14850c2ca84af39d5fd116ab483d5d.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896510/19272" target="_top" id="1896510">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896510" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896510/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Nice-looks-and-small-footprint-with-many-reservations"><a href="#Design-Nice-looks-and-small-footprint-with-many-reservations" class="headerlink" title="Design : Nice looks and small footprint, with many reservations"></a><strong>Design</strong> : <strong>Nice looks and small footprint, with many reservations</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk looks good in pictures but starts to fall apart a little when examined up close. Overall, HP did a pretty decent job here, but there are plenty of areas for improvement.</p><p> The first area of concern is the chassis itself. The shell of the OMEN case is constructed mainly out of plastic, which I’m sure helping a lot to keep shipping costs down, but definitely keeps the desktop from feeling like a solid, premium piece of hardware. It also makes me concerned about how durable it will be over time. Most buyers looking to spend this much on a gaming PC want to get some good mileage out of it, so this is somewhat disconcerting.</p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk looks good in pictures but starts to fall apart a little when examined up close.</p><p> The top&#x2F;front of the case features 2x USB 3.1 ports, a microphone and headphone port, and a power button. The USB ports are slightly misaligned on the model that I received making it a bit of a chore to plug anything in. I would love to have a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the front here since more and more peripherals are moving towards USB-C. An SD card reader would also have been nice for those out there that shoot video and photos, but I realize not everyone shares the same needs.</p><p> Upgraders and tinkerers will also find a mixed bag full of things to love and things to resent. The side of the case features a simple button release, so getting inside is extremely painless. If you are planning on adding more hard drives, HP has pre-wired two<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/serial-ata-sata-2626009" >SATA cables <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and SATA power connectors for you, and a plastic tray is present in the two drive bays for easy mounting.</p><p> Upgraders and tinkerers will also find a mixed bag full of things to love and things to resent.</p><p> Beyond adding more RAM or storage, you’re going to hit a wall pretty quickly. There are no mounts for additional fans to be installed anywhere, and there isn’t room in the case for many other CPU cooling options, should you be unhappy with the thermals. The pre-installed 120mm<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cooling-pads-4149823" >AIO water cooler <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is no match for the i9-9900k, where temperatures regularly crested 90°C during heavy workloads.</p><p> The OMEN gets plenty of things right as well. The plastic design might not be my favorite, but I absolutely adore the compact form factor. To put it in perspective, my already somewhat modest mid-tower case, the NZXT H440, measures 8.6 x 20.2 x 18.9 inches (HWD). The Omen, on the other hand, measures just 6.5 x 14.06 x 17.05 inches. Side by side, it’s plainly visible how much smaller the OMEN is, and for those with limited desk space, this will make a noticeable difference.</p><p> The lighting system is also approachable and understated, giving a little bit of customizable flare without going too over the top. As you’ll see later in the software section, HP has made it very straightforward to tweak any of these settings to your satisfaction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gfeGQoUwG35q5t-JwO07Ax4jm5I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-3-f4e655ec9e684a47855e9ee7373ba4b6.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Performance-Great-components-for-gaming-and-productivity"><a href="#Performance-Great-components-for-gaming-and-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Performance :Great components for gaming and productivity"></a><strong>Performance</strong> :<strong>Great components for gaming and productivity</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk that I tested featured a 9th Gen Intel Core i9 9900K, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and the Nvidia GTX GeForce 2080 Super graphics card. This is a potent combination of components in a gaming PC, and I was appropriately impressed by the results.</p><p> The desktop scored an impressive 6,967 in the productivity-focused benchmarking application PCMark 10. On the gaming front, the Omen managed a score of 10,740 in 3DMark’s Time Spy. In real-world use, this means more than 60fps at 4K in many popular titles like GTA V, but less than 60fps in others like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. In other words, the Omen is mostly capable of 4K gameplay and is nearly always capable of 60+ fps in most common resolutions shy of 4K.</p><p> The Omen comes equipped with a 1TB<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-m2-833453" >NVMe SSD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and 32GB of DDR4 2666 memory. This is definitely more RAM than games alone will call for, but it’s merely an adequate amount of RAM for some creative professionals working with more demanding software like Adobe After Effects. Keep in mind though, even those that don’t normally need a lot of RAM can still benefit from having more. Among other things, it gives you the luxury of keeping all of your browser tabs and background applications running without having to start juggling applications on and off, which can be helpful from a productivity standpoint.</p><h2 id="Gaming-Great-for-the-most-demanding-titles"><a href="#Gaming-Great-for-the-most-demanding-titles" class="headerlink" title="Gaming :Great for the most demanding titles"></a><strong>Gaming</strong> :<strong>Great for the most demanding titles</strong></h2><p> Gaming performance is great on the HP OMEN Obelisk thanks to the Nvidia GTX GeForce 2080 Super and Intel i9-9900K combo. I tested a number of games on my 3440x1440 monitor to get a sense of performance. To put this in perspective, this resolution is roughly 60 percent of the pixels of a 4K monitor.</p><p> First up was GTA V, which I tested with everything except for MSA (anti-aliasing) and the settings in the advanced tab turned up to Very High, the maximum setting. I recorded an average of 120.6fps across the 5 passes that the benchmark runs.</p><p> Emboldened by these results, I went back and turned every last thing up to its maximum setting, including everything in the advanced tab_and_ 8x MSA. I was quickly brought back down to earth, with an average result of 46.6fps. For one last pass, I nudged the MSA down to 4x, and came up with a healthy average of 66.8fps. Maybe dreams can come true after all.</p><p> Next, I wanted to try something fairly CPU intensive, so I ran the in-game benchmark for Civilization VI. I used the default settings for the Ultra preset, which netted me an average of 145.5fps. This was certainly an easy win for the OMEN Obelisk.</p><p> Lastly, I ran the notoriously resource-heavy Deus Ex: Mankind Divided using a few different profiles. On Ultra settings, the OMEN Obelisk saw just 55.7fps on average, with a minimum of 44.6fps and a maximum of 61.6fps. Dialing things down one level to Very High, things looked only slightly rosier: 58.1fps average, 49.5fps minimum, 62.2fps maximum. Finally, turning it down one more level to High found a sweet spot: 75.8fps average, 62.8fps minimum, 96.6 FPS maximum.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Pz9tV-mhJl_Cjm8HSqEQ_VZPbVE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-5-cdbd9d78a8c14b8e8bce0113d12e9fcc.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137212/26400" target="_top" id="2137212">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137212" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137212/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Network-Great-speeds-but-software-that-doesn’t-do-much"><a href="#Network-Great-speeds-but-software-that-doesn’t-do-much" class="headerlink" title="Network :Great speeds, but software that doesn’t do much"></a><strong>Network</strong> :<strong>Great speeds, but software that doesn’t do much</strong></h2><p> The HP Omen Obelisk has gigabit LAN and a Wi-Fi 5 (2x2) networking, the latter supporting a maximum speed of 866 Mbps. Everything functioned smoothly from a networking standpoint during my tests.</p><p> I made a point to try out the Network Booster software found in the OMEN Command Center and didn’t see anything tremendously useful, unfortunately. I tried setting the priority of Steam to “Low” and downloading a game, but the game still downloaded at my maximum internet speed. I took it one step further and toggled the “Block” option for Steam, and tried to resume the download, but Steam kept on downloading at the maximum speed. The software was successful in blocking Chrome when that option was switched on, however.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134489/18498" target="_top" id="2134489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134489/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Just-enough-options"><a href="#Software-Just-enough-options" class="headerlink" title="Software: Just enough options"></a><strong>Software: Just enough options</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk comes with the OMEN Command Center, which is used to manage your desktop as well as any other OMEN products such as headsets, keyboards, and mice. From here, you have the option to click on your desktop and start managing your PC or choose from one of the various other options such as rewards, coaching, remote play, and My Games (a game launcher).</p><p> Select OMEN DESKTOP and you can access system vitals like GPU utilization, CPU utilization, memory utilization, and CPU&#x2F;GPU temperatures. This is also where you can access the lighting profiles, overclocking options, and a “network booster” that lets you prioritize application bandwidth usage.</p><p> The lighting is executed fairly well on the HP OMEN Obelisk. There are only two lighting zones: one for the interior of the case, and one for the logo on the front exterior. Through the OMEN Command Center, you can set and customize lighting profiles for each zone. You can choose a static color, but also may choose from animation profiles that cycle between preset or user-defined colors. Luckily you can also choose the brightness, if you want to tone down the lighting a bit, and choose a separate profile for when the desktop is asleep.</p><p> The option to overclock your system has you first run a nondescript benchmark, which produces a score with no reference point (to establish a baseline). While it’s nice to have the option, this really,<em>sincerely</em> isn’t a system you want to be overclocking. The i9-9900K CPU already runs alarmingly hot, even with its pre-installed water cooling solution. There also isn’t enough room for anything beyond a 120mm AIO watercooler, and not nearly enough clearance for a popular air heatsink like the Noctua NH-D15.</p><h2 id="Price-Highly-competitive"><a href="#Price-Highly-competitive" class="headerlink" title="Price: Highly competitive"></a><strong>Price: Highly competitive</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk with the same specs as this one can be found for around $2,000, at least when it’s in stock. Despite a lot of flaws that I can point to a nit-pick about, the price is one of the main reasons I still consider the OMEN to be a solid deal. I went through the trouble of parting out a similar build on PCPartPicker, going as far as to cut corners where I usually wouldn’t, and still arrived at just under $1800 before tax.</p><p> As far as I’m concerned, $200 is a perfectly reasonable premium to pay for a system that is already assembled and shipped to your door.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J3cZUfrEy-ALtFpRbDRhw7FZI8M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-4-f78d504d7bd348eca19b7e65b4d10289.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="HP-OMEN-Obelisk-vs-Corsair-One-Pro"><a href="#HP-OMEN-Obelisk-vs-Corsair-One-Pro" class="headerlink" title="HP OMEN Obelisk vs Corsair One Pro"></a><strong>HP OMEN Obelisk vs Corsair One Pro</strong></h2><p> If you want something even smaller, and even more monolithic, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/corsair-one-pro-review-5072820" >Corsair One Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Systems/CORSAIR-ONE/CORSAIR-ONE-PRO-i180-Compact-Workstation-Grade-PC/p/CS-9040001-NA" >Corsair <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) manages to pack a high-end gaming rig in a minuscule 12-liter case, making even the HP OMEN seem large by comparison. It has a very solid construction and manages to fit water cooling for both the CPU and GPU inside its small frame.</p><p> The Corsair One will of course be less customizable and harder to work in, and caps out at 32GB of RAM as opposed to the OMEN’s 64GB. The main differentiation however is the price—the Corsair One in a similar configuration to the OMEN will cost at least $900 more. Nonetheless, for those that really don’t plan to do any tweaking whatsoever, that value space above all else, might still consider the Corsair One.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>High performance and fantastic value, but upsetting thermals.</strong></p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk delivers fantastic value for gamers shopping for a high-performance, pre-built PC. HP has come a long way, and now offers a much more compelling solution that will appeal to a much broader set of buyers. That said, there is work to be done still, as the case suffers from poor airflow, poor thermals, and not a lot of meaningful ways to improve them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1516072">

It boasts a 1080p FHD camera and 21x optical zoom that supports night vision capabilities. It can capture crisp footage up to 50 feet in the way, even in dark conditions. It has 64GB of built-in storage for recording video, photos, and audio.</p><p> Battery life is solid, with a 3,000mAh battery that should allow 10 hours of video recording, more than 11 hours of audio, or 20 hours of standby time. It should let you use the camera for the average workday without recharging.</p><p> Other features include password protection, which encrypts files so they can’t be stolen or deleted. The only way to delete files is by connecting through a computer with a USB cable.</p><p> Perhaps the most significant selling point is the IP67 waterproof rating, meaning the camera can survive complete submersion underwater. It’s also shock-resistant to withstand drops, bumps, and scrapes.</p><p><strong>Resolution</strong> : N&#x2F;A | <strong>Video Resolution</strong> : 1080p | <strong>Waterproof</strong> : IP67 | <strong>Zoom</strong> : 21x | <strong>Connectivity</strong> : Cable</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043618/7443" target="_top" id="2043618">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043618" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043618/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-Body-Cams"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-Body-Cams" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in Body Cams"></a>What to Look For in Body Cams</h2><p> The best body cam should have a durable, compact design, good video resolution, and long battery life, so it doesn’t need to be frequently recharged. Since body cameras are commonly used by outdoor adventurers, sports enthusiasts, and law enforcement, durability and a waterproof and shock resistance rating are essential to consider.</p><h3 id="Resolution-Video-Quality"><a href="#Resolution-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Resolution &amp; Video Quality"></a>Resolution &amp; Video Quality</h3><p> The key things you’ll want to have in a body cam are a resolution and video quality that’s crisp and smooth. The most standard resolution is 1080p at 30fps, which should give you smooth recording without breaking the budget. You can step up to 60fps if you want smoother recording (or slow down to 24fps for slow-motion effects). Above that, you get 4K, usually at 30fps, which is much sharper, resulting in a corresponding price increase.</p><h3 id="Durability-Waterproofing"><a href="#Durability-Waterproofing" class="headerlink" title="Durability &amp; Waterproofing"></a>Durability &amp; Waterproofing</h3><p> As with anything that gets worn and carried around with you all the time, durability is hugely important for a body cam. If you’re in law enforcement, you’ll want MIL-STD 810G, a certification that promises lab-tested shock resistance, drop resistance, and more. A waterproof rating is also essential, with IP65 meaning the device is protected against submersion in water up to 5m and also resistant to dust. There are higher and lower IP ratings, with IPX ratings meaning no dust resistance and just water.</p><h3 id="Battery-Life"><a href="#Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life"></a>Battery Life</h3><p> If you wear it all day, a body cam can’t be easily recharged, so battery life is essential. The size of the built-in cell can vary, with 1,000mAh to 3,000mAh being standard. Ideally, you’ll want a device to take you through an 8-hour workday. Most body cams likely won’t be able to last 24 hours since the battery size needs to be balanced against the compact and lightweight design. One option is to get a body cam with more than one battery so you can swap them out when one runs out of juice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-cheap-instant-cameras-6753002" >The Best Instant Cameras Under $100 of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Can you record other people with a body camera?<br> While there isn’t anything stopping you technically, it’s often better to ask permission before capturing video of anyone. However, if you are in a public area, you can take photos or videos of your surroundings. Laws surrounding body cameras can vary by state, so if you are concerned about the legalities of constantly recording video, we recommend checking out the <a class="link"   href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/body-worn-cameras-interactive-graphic.aspx#/" >NCSL Body-Worn Camera Laws Database <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Can you record law enforcement with a body camera?<br> Things become more muddled when using body cameras to record law enforcement. While you are technically allowed to record law enforcement, some states have tried to regulate audio recording under wiretapping laws. We recommend checking out this <a class="link"   href="https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights" >ACLU primer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for shooting videos of the police before going further.</li><li>Are police body cameras always on?<br> While an increasing number of police departments are required to wear and use body cameras, those body cameras aren’t continuously filming. In most cases, police officers can decide when they have a body camera on. Officers can turn on the body camera before an encounter (or, conversely, turn it off). Moreover, even if the body camera is on, the footage isn’t readily accessible to civilians.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-time-is-money-the-best-facebook-schedulers-reviewed/"><u>[New] In 2024, Time Is Money The Best Facebook Schedulers Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-sparkling-access-methods-for-new-users/"><u>2024 Approved Sparkling Access Methods for New Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/choosing-between-founders-gpu-and-asus-branded-alternatives/"><u>Choosing Between Founder's GPU & Asus-Branded Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/1721953515913-eager-for-chatgpt-on-your-desktop-but-in-limbo-explore-our-top-open-source-substitute-today/"><u>Eager for ChatGPT on Your Desktop but in Limbo?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Smartwatches bring a bounty of functionality to the table—and right to your wrist. But these devices also tend to cast a wider net that includes fitness tracking among many other tools like listening to music or responding to email. If focusing on workouts and general wellness is your priority, you may be interested in scaling back from a full-blown<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to a full-time fitness tracker like the Samsung Galaxy Fit.</p><p> This new addition to the Samsung wearable lineup carries over many of the hallmarks of smartwatches offered by the brand, but in a much slimmer profile and a more targeted and accurate focus on fitness.</p><p> We tested the Samsung Galaxy Fit on its ability to track workouts and how comfortable it is as a 24&#x2F;7 accessory.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Tf5FJJb3h1iBWaZIkx-ZF7NeOTg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-6-b9990e3655e34e2ca712150225748ab6.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Functional-and-slightly-elevated"><a href="#Design-Functional-and-slightly-elevated" class="headerlink" title="Design: Functional and slightly elevated"></a><strong>Design: Functional and slightly elevated</strong></h2><p> The Samsung Galaxy Fit is a fitness-oriented device, and the design reflects this. It’s clean, minimal, and straightforward. Not only is this wearable extremely lightweight at only 0.81 ounces, but it’s also quite slim, which gives it a bracelet-like appearance.</p><p> There’s only one button to interact with, and it’s located on the left side of the watch and is responsive and straightforward to use. The strap is made of durable rubber and includes plenty of notches for a close fit. While the band is more focused on ruggedness and skews more toward the typical fitness watch aesthetic, the screen gives the device a more refined appearance.</p><p> The face is long and narrow and features a crisp, full-color AMOLED 120 x 240 display. This bright display is pleasing to the eye, but the scroll interaction is somewhat awkward given the size of the screen. A very light touch is necessary, and even then, it may take some time to get used to scrolling on such a narrow surface area.</p><p> We found the quick-access menu particularly difficult to maneuver. A swipe down from the top of the screen reveals it, but swiping to the right to toggle through all the options often just closed the menu altogether.</p><p> While this watch is diminutive in size, it can withstand the wear and tear that comes with biking, swimming, and other activities. The device as a whole is rugged and heavy-duty enough to withstand 50 meters of water as well as a drop or two, according to the MIL-STD-810G durability rating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uFwssrqnoTWtrPSlF6y16TFjA5A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-2-2e9d9cba7ec342918320509e630b0f09.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135416/19272" target="_top" id="2135416">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135416" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135416/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983549">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983549">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983549%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983549/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Speedy-and-to-the-point"><a href="#Setup-Process-Speedy-and-to-the-point" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Speedy and to the point"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Speedy and to the point</strong></h2><p> Other than the watch itself, the only other equipment is a wireless charging dock. Charging to 100 percent is recommended at setup, and it took us about 40 minutes for the device to charge in full from about 70 percent charged out of the box.</p><p> After that, we downloaded the compatible app for the device, called Galaxy Fit. We were able to pair the device in just a few seconds. We also had to download the Samsung Health app in order to access our activity data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/E_Ki7o6LChwW9AdtjDKL2L1lHjw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-4-abd906dedc9c440188c23a5aabdfebe0.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012401/19272" target="_top" id="2012401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Almost-undetectable"><a href="#Comfort-Almost-undetectable" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Almost undetectable"></a><strong>Comfort: Almost undetectable</strong></h2><p> Like the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4174640" >Samsung Galaxy Watch Active <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , this device also features a tucked-in strap. The difference is that there’s a little pin with a round head instead of the straight pin that most watch buckles have. This detail makes for an extremely close fit that verges on almost too close.</p><p> The combination of such a close fit and little surface area made it a somewhat awkward to put on and take off the device—it was easier to ask for a second pair of hands to help nudge the strap out from underneath the band than wrestle with it alone.</p><p> While the fit can be tight, it was generally undetectable for most of the day, including while sleeping. When we did notice it, it was because it felt too snug, which was often the case by the end of day. Adjusting the fit for a looser feel left gapping in the band.</p><p> While the fit can be tight, its generally undetectable for most of the day—including while sleeping.</p><p> A little more surface area on the band and additional notches could be helpful for a more middle-of-the-line fit—what felt fine in the morning often felt way too tight by the end of the day.</p><p> So while it was mostly comfortable for general wear and during exercise activities, we found that the fit suffered from being either too tight or too loose because the adjustments weren’t incremental enough. It was hard to find a just-right middle ground.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SRdpyMKwwNLE2m_Dnn2o9thnpQ8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-3-40a8d98ca4a04e7c9b5b18531df43e6f.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Performance-High-marks-for-accuracy"><a href="#Performance-High-marks-for-accuracy" class="headerlink" title="Performance: High marks for accuracy"></a><strong>Performance: High marks for accuracy</strong></h2><p> Since fitness tracking is really the name of the game for this device, we had high hopes that it would perform well. We weren’t disappointed by what we found. We were pleased with its ability to automatically track running, swimming, and sleep activities.</p><p> On a walk, steps logged were in line with a Garmin watch we use to track activity, and so was running. The running data was particularly impressive to see stacked up against the running-focused Garmin watch. Even without initiating a run workout, mileage, time elapsed, pace, and cadence were all within very close range. The Garmin edged out the Galaxy Fit with heart rate and cadence details throughout the run instead of just an overall summary. But all in all, the accuracy was really quite spot on.</p><p> We were pleased with its ability to automatically track running, swimming, and sleep activities.</p><p> Samsung says that swimming is automatically detected by the watch and water lock mode will initiate on its own, and we found that to be spot on when we took this watch along for laps in the pool. The results compiled in the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-health-how-it-works-4172072" >Samsung Health <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app after the workout were also surprisingly detailed. We were able to see the strokes we’d performed and our corresponding pace, our stroke rate, overall distance covered, and something called SWOLF, which is a way to measure stroke efficiency.</p><p> One downside we noticed is that the Fit did not capture mileage for cycling workouts. While it did accurately and automatically track the time elapsed, there was little detail beyond that. The only way to track miles, pace, and speed was to launch a cycling workout through the Samsung Health app.</p><p> All activity data, including information on sleep quality and patterns, is laid out clearly in the supplementary Samsung Health app, which is particularly useful for viewing a week’s worth of activity data. It’s really the only way to see beyond the most recent activity or two, which is all the watch will show you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/APk5ikkGQieSTN39gBAQ6rf6H9E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-5-5ff5a7cfa0c34594b8d74bbb224e9800.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135399/19272" target="_top" id="2135399">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135399" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135399/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Good-for-a-full-week-of-use"><a href="#Battery-Good-for-a-full-week-of-use" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Good for a full week of use"></a><strong>Battery: Good for a full week of use</strong></h2><p> Samsung says this watch is good for up to seven to eight days with regular activity and use, and up to eleven days with minimal use. We found that this watch lasted on the initial charge for a full<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitness-trackers-with-the-best-battery-life-4077272" >eight days <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lined up with the manufacturer claims. It’s hard to say how the battery life would stack up to multiple workouts in a day—we typically only did one a day over the course of a week, but our experience with the device supports the strong battery life claims.</p><p> When we did have to charge the device again, we found that process to be speedy: it took only two hours to recharge in full.</p><h2 id="Software-Dial-up-your-fitness-with-the-Samsung-Health-app"><a href="#Software-Dial-up-your-fitness-with-the-Samsung-Health-app" class="headerlink" title="Software: Dial up your fitness with the Samsung Health app"></a><strong>Software: Dial up your fitness with the Samsung Health app</strong></h2><p> Unlike other Samsung smartwatches, the Samsung Galaxy Fit is built on a FreeRTOS (real time operation software) platform. This OS relies heavily on the companion smartphone app and the Samsung Health app for a well-rounded experience.</p><p> Most of the settings for notifications and even choosing quick, pre-written responses to texts can be set up through the mobile app. You can also choose watch faces to personalize the style of your Galaxy Fit—there’s a specific screen inside the app that details all the design options and allows you to change the look whenever you want.</p><p> In addition to controlling the watch settings easily from the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Samsung Health app is the other go-to resource. Here you can view all the information captured by the activity tracker, including fitness, sleep, and even stress levels. You can also take this a step further by using the app to monitor calories, weight, and water intake.</p><h2 id="Price-Great-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Great-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Great for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Great for what you get</strong></h2><p> The Samsung Galaxy Fit retails for $99.99, which makes it a strong competitor in the fitness tracker market. Similarly-priced devices from the Fitbit brand offer an equivalent bundle of all-day activity tracking and general wellness features but lack the vibrant display of the Galaxy Fit.</p><p> There are cheaper options out there, too, like the Garmin vívofit 4, which sells for between $60 and $80. But it lacks a heart rate monitor or the smart capabilities of the Fit, like canned text-messaging responses and the ability to send calls straight to voicemail. For the activity tracking and smart device functionality, the Fit is a fair price and maybe even a bargain for some.</p><h2 id="Samsung-Galaxy-Fit-vs-Fitbit-Inspire-HR"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-Fit-vs-Fitbit-Inspire-HR" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy Fit vs. Fitbit Inspire HR"></a><strong>Samsung Galaxy Fit vs. Fitbit Inspire HR</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Inspire HR is a close competitor to the Samsung Galaxy Fit. Both are priced at just below $100 and have many of the same wellness and activity tracking features. Both are water resistant up to 50 meters, track active and resting heart rate, feature sport profiles, log sleeping activity, and integrate various types of notifications.</p><p> But the Galaxy Fit offers wireless charging and a full-color display, while the Fitbit Inspire HR comes with a charging cable and sports a grayscale<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091" >OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display. The Fitbit also only has a five-day battery life versus the maximum eleven-day battery life on the Fit.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Rexing V1 DashCam is a great choice if you’re in the market for a security-style dashboard camera. Its size and shape are more suited to windshield mounting than other models we tested, plus it captures high-definition footage, decent sound, and is an overall reliable device.</p><p> It has all the additional features you’d expect from a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/types-of-dash-cameras-534889" >dashcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , like loop recording and crash detection, and even some unique ones like timelapse recording. If you’re in the market for a dashcam, the Rexing V1 is definitely worth considering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JfL4E5NnuBPl6-93Hv3PI4IJsV0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_05-bcfff5f440b545378c9ee4e6b431ffac.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-Fits-perfectly-on-your-windshield"><a href="#Design-Fits-perfectly-on-your-windshield" class="headerlink" title="Design: Fits perfectly on your windshield"></a><strong>Design: Fits perfectly on your windshield</strong></h2><p> The Rexing V1 Dashcam has a more distinctive form factor than other models we reviewed. Unlike many popular dashcam models, the V1 doesn’t resemble a point-and-shoot camera that hangs from your windshield. Rather, it’s angled to fit the curve of the glass. This makes for a more integrated, smooth look.</p><p> And it’s not just looks that make the design appealing. The fact that it’s not a simple square allows easier access to the control panel, improves the viewing angle of the display, and makes navigating the already-simple interface a bit easier.</p><p> There’s only one way to install this camera in your car, and that’s via a mount that sticks to your windshield with an adhesive strip. Fortunately, this works really well and the mount stays in place—throughout our testing, jolts and bumps on the road didn’t budge it. And once the camera was installed on our windshield, it was very easy to slide it on and off the mount.</p><p> Throughout our testing, jolts and bumps on the road didn’t budge it.</p><p> At just 2.7 inches, the display on this dash cam is the smallest among the devices we tested, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. All the icons, menus, and video footage itself are perfectly visible up close. And you probably don’t want to be paying attention to the screen while you’re behind the wheel, anyways—the at-a-glance view of the camera’s status is all you need.</p><p> It also has an internal accelerometer that can detect the impact of an accident, as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-gps-how-it-works-4688647" >GPS capabilities <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with all the necessary equipment to use the GPS feature—if you want to enable these, you have to buy the<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Rexing-GPS-Logger-V1-V1P/dp/B01AKH377A/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4770571%7Cn9eae1cd5706347139b8b83241f9d42ea10%7C" >Rexing GPS Logger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> separately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ztn3EsFqtKkWImvQhtgcr1vlHwI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_02-9ee3aa46e7394a1ab263a6b12b287314.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1166360/14483" target="_top" id="1166360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1166360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1166360/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Be-sure-that’s-where-you-want-to-put-it"><a href="#Setup-Process-Be-sure-that’s-where-you-want-to-put-it" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Be sure that’s where you want to put it"></a><strong>Setup Process: Be sure that’s where you want to put it</strong></h2><p> For those concerned about the hassle of installing a dashcam, don’t worry. The user manual for the Rexing V1 was the clearest and most detailed of all the dashcams we tested. The instructions are written in easy-to-understand language, and every button, feature, and tool is explained in detail so there’s no guesswork when you turn the device on.</p><p> Attaching this dash cam to your windshield is easy. Simply pull the plastic off the double-sided adhesive on the mount and stick it where you want it to go. However, you should be very careful when you’re doing this and make absolutely certain that you want it where you put it the first time. After a few seconds of being attached, it’s on there for good, and it takes a decent amount of ingenuity and elbow grease to get it off. Once it’s off, you can’t reapply it.</p><p> One of the things we appreciated about this dash cam is that it includes a 32GB<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so you won’t have to put out extra cash to get one. However, there is no microSD card adapter, so if you want to review your footage on a computer you’ll have to buy one of those.</p><p> Also included in the box is a special tool that helps you hide the power cable. To prevent the wire from hanging down in front of your windshield, you need to wedge it up under the edge of the roof and through the side panels (the instruction manual shows you the best route to take). It may seem complicated at first, but this whole process only took us about ten minutes to accomplish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/df0_L-UzAk3OryqSCncsjfqi8QM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_03-2273fff3f71944368711b60f5da9687e.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834903">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834903">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834903%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834903/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Basic"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Basic" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Basic"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Basic</strong></h2><p> You can set this dash-mounted camera to capture footage in either 720p or 1080p resolution, which is pretty limited. Similar dashcams can capture footage up to 2560 x 1440 resolution, with others going all the way up to 4K. However, if all you’re looking for is a simple security device, 1080p will do just fine.</p><p> When we reviewed the footage captured by the Rexing V1, we found it to be highly detailed and clear when the car was moving along city streets. However, when we hit the freeway, the picture became a little less clear. Signs were hard to read unless you stopped the recording, and small details such as license plates and bumper stickers on other cars couldn’t be made out at all. Nevertheless, the videos yield a good picture of what happens when you drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9_1pHoEq74JWPJ8reothv8PeI8E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_04-c5d42af8ddfa4296a6c6b1e8551edef6.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1542129">                    <video width="864" height="1152" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1542129">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1542129%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1542129/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Performance-Set-it-and-forget-it"><a href="#Performance-Set-it-and-forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Set it and forget it"></a><strong>Performance: Set it and forget it</strong></h2><p> During our testing, we took the Rexing V1 on several lengthy drives through the cities and countryside of northern Utah. In the week that we had it, we never had a problem with how it functioned. It stayed firmly attached to the windshield, powered on every time we turned the ignition and never missed a frame while we were driving. This is one of those devices that embodies the “set it and forget it” mentality.</p><p> This dashcam uses loop recording, which means that it is continuously recording while your car is on, but splices it up into manageable bits rather than one long file. Rexing recommends setting this to three minutes, but you have options to set it to five- and ten-minute intervals as well. When your memory card fills up, the device automatically overwrites the oldest files.</p><p> It stayed firmly attached to the windshield, powered on every time we turned the ignition and never missed a frame while we were driving.</p><p> This dashcam is also equipped with an internal accelerometer that gives it the ability to detect a traffic accident. When it senses that an incident has occurred, it automatically locks the video for that time to prevent it from being overwritten. This is a common feature among the dash cams we tested, but it works well and is a great way to protect yourself if you ever need to prove what happened in an accident.</p><p> One feature that is unique to the Rexing V1 is time-lapse recording. It is turned off by default and Rexing recommends you keep it off for your day-to-day driving. But if you’re taking a road trip with scenic routes or want to record a particular journey, this feature is fun to have.</p><p> Like the rest of the dashboard cameras we tested, the Rexing V1 has the ability to record audio, but it does a middling job of it. Voices in the car and sounds coming from the interior speakers were clear enough to understand, but sounds from outside the vehicle were muddy at best.</p><h2 id="Price-A-good-value"><a href="#Price-A-good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: A good value"></a><strong>Price: A good value</strong></h2><p> The Rexing V1 retails for $130, but as of the time of this writing, can typically be purchased for closer to $100. We feel like this is a perfectly appropriate price for this device—it falls right in the middle of the typical dashcam price range, providing better performance than super budget models, but without the high-tech features of the more expensive options out there. In short, it’s a good price for a solid, basic device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424533">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424533.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424533">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424533.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424533%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424533/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Z3-Plus-vs-Rexing-V1"><a href="#Competition-Z3-Plus-vs-Rexing-V1" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Z3 Plus vs. Rexing V1"></a><strong>Competition: Z3 Plus vs. Rexing V1</strong></h2><p> If you’re wondering if you want to pay the extra $25 or so for the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam (which retails for $125), the decision will come down to form factor and image quality—everything else is pretty much the same.</p><p> The Z3 Plus is square and hangs from your windshield from a suction cup, so it can stick out like a sore thumb. The V1 doesn’t have that problem since it’s angled to fit your windshield, but the adhesive tape that holds it on is one-time-use only. If you make a mistake when installing it, you may end up wishing for the Z3’s clunky suction cup design.</p><p> If the Rexing V1’s 1080p resolution is good enough for you, there’s no need to put down extra cash for more pixels. The video is definitely high-res enough to use as a security device, and can effectively capture an accident or other incident. But if you want great video footage that you’ll enjoy watching in the future, an extra $25 isn’t too high a price to pay.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>It delivers on what it was designed to do, without any extras.</strong></p><p> There isn’t much to complain about with the Rexing V1 DashCam. Its innovative form factor combined with a wide array of video capture features and decent picture quality means you won’t have any buyer’s remorse if you choose this dashcam.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  V1 DashCam</li><li>Product Brand  Rexing</li><li>MPN  REX-V1</li><li>Price  $99.99</li><li>Weight  14 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  6.6 x 4.9 x 2.8 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Display Type  LCD</li><li>Recording Quality  Up to 1080p</li><li>Night Vision  No</li><li>Connectivity Options  MicroSD, USB</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-visual-vibrancy-a-step-by-step-on-animating-story-captions/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Visual Vibrancy A Step-by-Step on Animating Story Captions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-five-easy-steps-to-enhance-photo-hues-for-2024/"><u>[New] Five Easy Steps to Enhance Photo Hues for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-review-of-syma-x5c-the-ultimate-drone-guide-for-new-users/"><u>2024 Approved Review of Syma X5C – The Ultimate Drone Guide for New Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-advanced.techidaily.com/gmailyahoooutlook/"><u>古いGmail/Yahoo/Outlookメールバックアップからのデータ復元手順</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-roku-device-offers-vast-entertainment-collection/"><u>Budget-Friendly Roku Device Offers Vast Entertainment Collection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/choosing-the-perfect-iphone-for-your-mobile-gaming-needs/"><u>Choosing the Perfect iPhone for Your Mobile Gaming Needs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/effortless-guide-on-updating-device-drivers-in-windows-881/"><u>Effortless Guide on Updating Device Drivers in Windows 8/8.1</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/exploring-the-features-of-google-nest-hello-smart-doorbell-facial-recognition-and-security-alerts/"><u>Exploring the Features of Google Nest Hello Smart Doorbell - Facial Recognition & Security Alerts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-all-must-knows-to-use-fake-gps-go-location-spoofer-on-xiaomi-redmi-13c-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, All Must-Knows to Use Fake GPS GO Location Spoofer On Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-creative-ae-templates-select-10/"><u>In 2024, Creative AE Templates Select 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/in-depth-ratchet-and-clank-evaluation-timeless-adventure-revitalized/"><u>In-Depth Ratchet & Clank Evaluation: Timeless Adventure Revitalized</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/is-the-apeman-c450-the-best-value-in-dashcams-rigorous-budget-camera-assessment-inside/"><u>Is the Apeman C450 the Best Value in Dashcams?

Its vibrant colors, memorable animations, and constant updates serve to keep gameplay fresh for returning players, but remain stable enough so as not to disrupt new players’ experiences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z5kydB0kP2A67yJxqmRGCP6KuT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_04-f788a639837845a9aead0db474cbc72d.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2141688/17094" target="_top" id="2141688">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2141688" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluetties.sjv.io/i/5597632/2141688/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1167086/14483" target="_top" id="1167086">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1167086" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1167086/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way"><a href="#Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way" class="headerlink" title="Plot: None, but it’s better that way"></a><strong>Plot: None, but it’s better that way</strong></h2><p> Fortnite is plot light, a battle royale designed like the Hunger Games in that it drops players onto a map with one singular goal: survive to the end of the match and be the only player, or squad, left standing. Instead of a continuous story mode, players experience dramatic shifts in the game mechanics and the map season-to-season.</p><p> These include new explorable areas, changes to existing areas, weapon buffs, and new in-game mechanics, such as fishing or the addition of boats. Past seasons have included airplanes, snowboards, mechs and more—so who knows what future seasons will hold. The Battle Royale mode can become a little repetitive over time, but that’s why new seasons are important. They change up the pace of the game and reinvigorate the interest of players. The one guarantee is that each new season brings change, and with the dawn of Chapter 2, it’s clear that Epic Games hasn’t lost their touch for re-imagining their game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u0p3ac203yN2fyC3DvKLcXMqdAY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fornite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_02-8da4487c33dc4aed81eabc862664a1f8.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play</strong></h2><p> To win the Victory Royale, players compete solo, with a partner, or in squads of three to four people. Games are quick, lasting anywhere from 15-20 minutes once you get the hang of things, although it’s always possible to die earlier. The game starts by placing 100 players on Spawn Island while it queues up the teams. Once ready, everyone on the island is transported onto a Battle Bus which floats over the Fortnite map, allowing players to leap down and begin their quest to the top.</p><p> What’s better—not only is the Battle Royale mode free, but cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><p> Play is simple: loot chests, explore areas while scavenging for weapons and ammunition, chug potions to gain shields, and use your pickaxe to harvest materials by breaking down the world around you. Essentially, do whatever it takes to gear up fast and take down other players. With five item slots available, it’s important to grab at least one weapon (though we’d recommend grabbing several if you can), but the remaining slots can be used to carry healing items, potions, fishing reels, and other gear—but don’t dally too long deciding because the storm is coming.</p><p> The storm is an ever-encroaching threat that closes over set intervals and deals damage that increases over time to players trapped within its boundaries, forcing everyone closer together as the safe zone shrinks. The last team standing will claim the Victory Royale for themselves.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Good-campy-fun"><a href="#Graphics-Good-campy-fun" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Good, campy fun"></a><strong>Graphics: Good, campy fun</strong></h2><p> Fortnite’s graphics are campy, oversaturated, and brightly-colored fun making them a treat to look at. Unlike competitors such as PUBG or Apex Legends, Fortnite’s graphics trade realism for cartoonish, exaggerated features. When combined with the emotes and skins earned throughout the game, these can create some very entertaining in-game visuals.</p><p> It’s worth noting that DirectX 12 support is officially here for PC users, which means that people playing on higher quality graphics cards should see a more consistent gameplay experience thanks to an increased and more stable frame rate. If your system is older, you can play on reduced settings, but it does make the picture choppy and difficult to follow. It’ll get the job done, but we wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1EGFvaMlK-nV8KKnng7WcI-X7iI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_03-aff88589c9a04d05a9663f5a75975706.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123727/7443" target="_top" id="2123727">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123727" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123727/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134491/18498" target="_top" id="2134491">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134491" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134491/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more"><a href="#Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more" class="headerlink" title="Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more"></a><strong>Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more</strong></h2><p> A battle royale it may be, but Fortnite’s unique building mechanics truly set the game apart and turn the heat up a notch. All that harvesting you’re doing will pay off, because for every 10 stacks of a material such as wood or stone you have, you can build a structure. Be aware that durability and build time will vary based on the selected material, so take time to experiment and find what techniques work best for you.</p><p> Building is as important as shooting, so it’s essential to learn the basics. Players can build floors, stairs, roofs, and walls, which can be used either in defense or, for the imaginative player, in offense. These structures help players gain the higher ground on the battlefield, access hard-to-reach map locations, and buy time for healing items or shielding potions. It seems counterintuitive to be building anything in a battle royale game, but within moments structures will cobble itself together before a player’s eyes.</p><p> For the more casual player, these building controls can be found on the keyboard, but binding the building keys to unused mouse buttons can quickly become an asset on the battlefield where every second counts. A seamless defense can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><h2 id="Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass"><a href="#Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass"></a><strong>Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass</strong></h2><p> The seasonal Battle Pass system offers rewards to players as they gain experience in the game, a change from the previous system Chapter 1 used which relied on leveling up through Battle Stars earned from Weekly Challenges. The shift to experience-based leveling feels much more intuitive. And honestly, it’s fun to watch the experience bar increase during the match, although it’d be better if you could toggle its presence to collapse or display in the HUD.</p><p> If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer.</p><p> Just like Chapter 1, Chapter 2’s Battle Pass offers both free and premium rewards. This is in addition to the microtransactions offered for cosmetic upgrades in the Fortnite Shop. These rewards are purely cosmetic, but offer big personalities. They vary from new skins, such as rescue workers or monsters made from Slurp Juice (the solution which shields players from damage), new gliders for launching onto the map, new pickaxes and backpacks, as well as silly dances and emotes for goofy fun.</p><p> To access the premium rewards, players need to buy into the Battle Pass by purchasing in-game currency known as V-Bucks. The Battle Pass costs 950 V-Bucks or $9.50. If you value cosmetic upgrades, it’s a fun add-on. If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer. Each Battle Pass is only valid for the season in which they are bought, so if you’re joining late in the season consider if it’s worth it to invest in a reward system you may not be able to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ock_qOb167XfWuEIuPpuFC0DpUQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_Battle-Royale_Standard-Mode_05-95fe04b07a934bdbbcf8ae58496c736c.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety"><a href="#Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety" class="headerlink" title="Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety"></a><strong>Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety</strong></h2><p> As if the game mechanics and the cosmetics weren’t thrilling enough, Epic Games takes the shake-ups a step further by offering alternative modes, limited-time game modes, and events with unique rewards.</p><p> These include permanent alternative modes like Team Rumble, which features teams of 50 versus 50 who compete for an elimination count to win the match, or crossover events between DC, Marvel, Stranger Things, John Wick, the NFL, and more. These crossover events aren’t just combat-based—Epic Games has gone as far as hosting a virtual concert on its servers with Marshmello, a popular DJ and Fortnite fan himself. It may seem strange, but Epic consistently seeks out ways to reinvent the game and push the boundaries of what video games are capable of handling. This ensures that Fortnite remains fresh and interesting.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner.</p><h2 id="Price-Free-to-play"><a href="#Price-Free-to-play" class="headerlink" title="Price: Free to play"></a><strong>Price: Free to play</strong></h2><p> The only decision players need to make is whether or not they want to pick up the Battle Pass, which retails for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50). Otherwise,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >Fortnite Battle Royale <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is free and available on almost every major platform: PC&#x2F;Mac, Xbox One, PS4, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch. What’s better—cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><h2 id="Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale"><a href="#Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale" class="headerlink" title="Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale"></a><strong>Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale</strong></h2><p> Battle royale games have seen a lot of shake-up in the field lately, with the latest challenger arriving in February 2019 thanks to Respawn Entertainment’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends" >Apex Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Apex Legends is a first-person shooter meets battle royale game where 60 players are dropped onto a map competing with squads of three for domination.</p><p> Now boasting a player base of 70 million people, Apex Legends is quickly catching on Steam. All around, it feels like a more adult version of Fortnite. Instead of oversaturated, cartoonish graphics, goofy dances, and emotes, players are greeted by a more refined world that’s a glorious clash of fire and ice, and a graphics engine reminiscent of the Titanfall franchise. Running around lava fields, ziplining through ice craters, and skydiving into the skyscrapers of Capitol City is a real treat. One of the best parts of the map is the train system which spans the island, enabling quick travel between locations—and unexpected attacks of opportunity.</p><p> In addition to its fantastic graphics, Apex Legends offers a sophisticated ping system that communicates looting, enemy behavior, good-natured jibes, and movement tactics, among other call-outs. It’s a system Fortnite has even shifted into adopting, in a more limited manner. Unlike Fortnite’s weapon system, Apex Legends includes weapon attachments for additional customization options. These range from scopes, extended magazines, hop-ups to alter rate of fire, stocks, and barrel stabilizers.</p><p> Recently reaching its third season, Apex Legends offers its own Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins or $9.50, although the rewards don’t seem nearly as enticing as those offered by Fortnite. It too offers both free rewards and paid rewards for players who buy into the Battle Pass, but the free rewards are few and far between. Many of the player skins and weapon skins are fun, but their presence seems counterintuitive—particularly when you consider that you rarely see the player skins you earn in Apex Legends thanks to its first-person shooter style. The only time you can appreciate them, aside from the loading screens, are when you perform finishing moves, revive a player, or skydive, which seems strange for something you’re able to customize as well as purchase additional cosmetics for through microtransactions.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner. If you’re looking for a more advanced game, however, Apex Legends is an appealing challenger and well worth a second look—and just like Fortnite, Apex Legends is free to play.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is so cumbersome, unsightly, and complicated that I secretly wanted it to fail. Despite my attempts to judge this book by its cover, however, it was one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of all the ones I tested. Serves me right I suppose.</p><p> If you live far enough from your local TV signal source that other indoor antennas have failed you, the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might actually provide some help. Buyers should probably make sure that they can’t get away with a smaller, cheaper, simpler solution first, but if or when that fails, this antenna definitely gets the job done.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vY1j7QoS0FLwOKNhPlSfR3XMlmo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_02-e97897fe03b74f5faa2eefad3b3b7208.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future"><a href="#Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Glimpsing an ugly future"></a><strong>Design: Glimpsing an ugly future</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna looks something like what I would imagine a space prison to look like. It’s far larger than any of the other antennas that I tested, and during every step of the assembly I kept thinking to myself “well that part can’t possibly be necessary.” From the comically long antennas and giant metal grate, to the bulbous hollowed out spheres, there is a lot going on here.</p><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup.</p><p> As you’ll see later though, this is because the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna doesn’t really care about looks. Everything is 100% about function. There are, however, a few little elements from a design perspective that help make the ClearStream a somewhat thoughtful device nonetheless. Once assembled, all the parts fit together nicely like a lego set.</p><h2 id="Setup-Buckle-up"><a href="#Setup-Buckle-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Buckle up"></a><strong>Setup: Buckle up</strong></h2><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup. The instructions that come included have illustrations that show how everything fits together, but it isn’t outlined in the simplest manner possible.</p><p> Like a piece of IKEA furniture, the specific orientation of a lot of parts matter, even if they appear to fit together multiple ways. The manual doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining this, and I could see it leading to some frustration. Once you get the cage in place and secured, the rest of it comes together fairly easily though.</p><p> Once the entire device is assembled, the real work begins in my opinion. Now you have to figure out how and where to mount this beast of an antenna. Antenna’s Direct has you covered here, including a hefty bracket and swiveling mast that will help you mount the antenna to just about anywhere with a flat surface that you don’t mind screwing some bolts into.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136545/16384" target="_top" id="2136545">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136545" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136545/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Top-tier"><a href="#Performance-Top-tier" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Top tier"></a><strong>Performance: Top tier</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception. I tested the antenna indoors along with the rest of the suite of indoor antennas, and in the same orientation. Perhaps it would have benefited from being placed outside, but in the interest of fairness I used the same method for all.</p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception.</p><p> In my channel acquisition test, the ClearStream managed 76 channels consistently, far and away the best result from any of the devices I tested. The worst antenna I tested picked up just 47 channels, and the second best, 69. Needless to say, all the wires, cages, and bulbous plastic spheres are clearly doing something here, because this was the best result I saw.</p><h2 id="Range-Extensive"><a href="#Range-Extensive" class="headerlink" title="Range: Extensive"></a><strong>Range: Extensive</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is rated for up to 60 miles. These ratings are generally based on relatively unobstructed paths between the signal and your device. There is a lot less than 60 miles between me and my local TV broadcast source, but if the other results are any indication, the ClearStream has a fighting chance at living up to these claims.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NoQoQy3-EFUpi1z9oMTpD2JGWHQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_04-70f5a48ac9a347d286c71240b85cbc1c.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135412/19272" target="_top" id="2135412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135412/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap"><a href="#Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap"></a><strong>Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has a list price of $120 and a 90-day rolling average price on Amazon of $83. This is significantly more than any of the other antennas I tested, some of which could be had for around $25. If you live far enough that you need a better performing antenna, however, it could easily be worth every penny. I would only caution buyers to make sure they really do need this performance before pulling the trigger on this very large antenna.</p><h2 id="ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> I figured it might be interesting to compare the cheapest antenna to the most expensive antenna. If you are living inside of a city, fairly close to a signal source, you can probably get away with a cheaper antenna like the $25 amplified antenna by manufacturer 1byone. This flat, simple antenna takes up far less space and still managed to get 59 channels. It also maintained a clear picture on all of the major network stations just fine.</p><p> If you live further or in a more obstructed path, however, the 1byone probably wouldn’t cut it at all. It’s rather all-or-nothing. If you do genuinely need a more capable antenna, it could be make or break for your TV-viewing experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great performance for those that need it.</strong><br> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna isn’t the cheapest or best-looking antenna on the market, but it gets the job done better than any of the other antennas we tested. Buyers who know they need an antenna with better range and performance will find this to be a noticeable bump from cheaper indoor antennas.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948937/19272" target="_top" id="1948937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  ClearStream</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2012</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  60 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-ace-gaming-the-top-4k-tvs-on-market/"><u>[New] Ace Gaming The Top 4K TVs on Market</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ecording-with-precision-perfecting-ios-device-features-on-youtube/"><u>[New] Recording with Precision Perfecting iOS Device Features on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-prime-chrome-drawing-programs-the-ultimate-list/"><u>[Updated] Prime Chrome Drawing Programs The Ultimate List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-turn-any-surface-into-a-broadcasting-space-with-vlcs-webcam-feature/"><u>2024 Approved Turn Any Surface Into a Broadcasting Space with VLC’s Webcam Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/battle-of-wireless-routers-is-tp-links-archer-ax6000-a-true-contender-to-nighthawk-ax12-dominance/"><u>Battle of Wireless Routers: Is TP-Link's Archer AX6000 a True Contender to Nighthawk AX12 Dominance?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-assessment-of-the-dell-xps-13-7390-convertible-ultrabook-style-meets-functionality/"><u>Comprehensive Assessment of the Dell XPS 13 7390 Convertible Ultrabook - Style Meets Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/experience-lighting-evolution-exclusive-deal-on-the-powerful-yn560iv/"><u>Experience Lighting Evolution - Exclusive Deal on the Powerful YN560IV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-xr-with-imei-code-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Unlock Apple iPhone XR with IMEI Code?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-rhythm-and-pixels-recording-in-a-mac-studio/"><u>In 2024, Rhythm and Pixels Recording in a Mac Studio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/mastery-over-miscues-a-complete-handbook-for-sticker-deletion-on-tiktok/"><u>Mastery Over Miscues A Complete Handbook for Sticker Deletion on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/migration-mastery-moving-from-win7-to-win11/"><u>Migration Mastery: Moving From Win7 to Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/outdated-or-optimal-for-your-online-needs-a-thorough-review-of-the-netgear-c3-grower-style-router/"><u>Outdated or Optimal for Your Online Needs?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Indoor TV antennas, like the AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna, can provide you with free broadcast TV channels. Once you pay the upfront cost for the antenna you’re not stuck with any monthly fees for your local channels. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are nothing like the bunny ear style antennas from back in the day. The picture quality is comparable to what you’d get from the cable company or streaming service—or it’s supposed to be. I tested the ultra-affordable AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a viable option.</p><h2 id="Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic"><a href="#Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic" class="headerlink" title="Design: It’s all in the name (basic)"></a><strong>Design: It’s all in the name (basic)</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna has a slim design—it’s about as thin as card stock at approximately one-tenth of an inch in thickness. It’s constructed of sturdy plastic, with a reversible black and white side to help it fit better with your home’s decor. It’s not the most attractive antenna, and the backboards smudge and show grease and fingerprints.</p><p> It doesn’t come with a stand, but it does include 3M double-sided adhesives you can use to attach the antenna to walls or other surfaces. It also comes with a 10-foot long coax cable, which is removable. The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><p> The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><h2 id="Setup-Relatively-easy"><a href="#Setup-Relatively-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Relatively easy"></a><strong>Setup: Relatively easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is pretty straightforward. You start by plugging one end of the coaxial cable into the antenna, and then the other end to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connector to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Finding the best placement for the antenna is perhaps the most difficult part, as a few inches can make a difference in your available channel selection. My test home is under a canopy of trees in a pretty rural area, and I found the best placement was on the window. Ideally, you’ll want to direct the antenna towards tower transmitters, while also doing your best to reduce obstacles (think trees, electrical interference, and walls). You’ll want to place the antenna high up as well.</p><p> Next, you change your TV to the correct input (usually TV, antenna, or Coax). Then, go to your TV’s menus and start the auto-programming process, which<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >scans for available channels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The process takes a few minutes, and sometimes your TV won’t start to locate channels until about halfway through the auto-programming process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/z_YIDnD2uHBFyEpRQlkQ1HUaA_8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-2-e19a3a09a82f438d8f902ded5b0fecd4.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area"><a href="#Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)"></a><strong>Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)</strong></h2><p> So many things<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >affect an antenna’s performance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —location, household electronics, tree cover, tower location, and more. The antenna displays channels of high quality. However, sometimes the channels would take a few seconds to load, and other times, I’d see a pixelated effect when I first changed the channel that would clear up after a few seconds. Once the picture was fully loaded, it was in clear high definition. The antenna is capable of displaying a clear HD picture, so I couldn’t tell the difference between the antenna’s picture and the picture from streaming services like Hulu or Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GRXmDZjwX-_X2TyOZoHytHKrjDY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-3-70b77c023b7049ef985c61cf6f5064ad.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Range-35-miles"><a href="#Range-35-miles" class="headerlink" title="Range: 35 miles"></a><strong>Range: 35 miles</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics antenna has a 35-mile range, which isn’t very far considering 50 plus miles is becoming more common. It is omnidirectional, however, so you don’t need to point it in a specific direction. It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><p> Even with the short-range, I was able to pick up 16 channels on my first attempt, including The CW, PBS, and more. In a different room in my test home, I was able to get 23 channels, but this is probably because there’s less tree cover outside of the house on that side of the property. Considering the location of my test home, 23 channels is pretty good.</p><p> It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975555">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975555.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975555">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975555.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975555%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975555/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Super-affordable"><a href="#Price-Super-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Super affordable"></a><strong>Price: Super affordable</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Flat TV antenna sells in used condition on Amazon for only $13. In new condition, it sells for $20, which is still a great deal. However, you can find other affordable antennas for between $20 and $50 that provide a much longer range, and many offer additional features, like a longer cable. With the AmazonBasics model, you can return the unit within 30 days if it doesn’t work in your area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MN6DSsu9Myyo6CdrSW5MJTjHoug=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-4-fd9968307cb44c9d9e824750413e0028.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135405/19272" target="_top" id="2135405">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135405" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135405/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna"><a href="#AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna"></a><strong>AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 (see<a class="link"   href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/ANTOP-Omni-Directional-Indoor-HD-UHF-VHF-TV-Antenna/1000503257" >online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a 40-mile range antenna that sells for around $35. It’s one of the better-looking antennas I’ve seen, as it’s reversible with faux light wood and dark wood sides. Unlike the AmazonBasics antenna, the Antop comes with a stand, and it has an easy-push connector for faster setup. These features go some ways towards justifying the Antop’s higher price tag.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A budget antenna that works as advertised.</strong></p><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna is a good option for anyone who wants an ultra-cheap way to get broadcast TV.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Ultra-Thin Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  AmazonBasics</li><li>SKU  DVB-T9088</li><li>Price  $20.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.09 x 13.31 x 0.075 in.</li><li>Warranty  30 day return policy, One year limited warranty</li><li>Resolution  1080p</li><li>Range  35 miles</li><li>Frequency  174-230 MHz</li><li>Receiving range  VHF&#x2F;UHF</li><li>Atenna version  Passive</li><li>Ports  Coax</li><li>Cable length  10-foot Coax Cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-hero5-in-focus-advanced-photography-and-video-guide-for-gopro/"><u>[New] Hero5 in Focus Advanced Photography & Video Guide for GoPro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/bridge-the-gap-between-viewers-and-wide-angles-posting-on-facebook/"><u>Bridge the Gap Between Viewers and Wide Angles Posting on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-imo-chat-app-evaluation/"><u>Comprehensive Imo Chat App Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/decoding-the-role-of-shap-in-machine-learning-clarity/"><u>Decoding the Role of SHAP in Machine Learning Clarity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/enhance-audio-experience-on-your-iphone-device/"><u>Enhance Audio Experience on Your iPhone Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/high-definition-superzoom-photos-canon-sx70-to-the-rescue/"><u>High-Definition Superzoom Photos?

These tools are a must-have for anyone looking to purchase a second-hand vehicle, allowing you to quickly reveal any glaring inadequacies the previous owner may have failed to mention.</p><h2 id="Best-Overall"><a href="#Best-Overall" class="headerlink" title="Best Overall"></a>Best Overall</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB01G5EA74I" >Ancel Classic OBD Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/89GEP5wvXrJ2pm04eqq2t7sjeNs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ancel-classic-enhanced-universal-obd-ii-scanner-49eabf2abdfb48d18a3374996f6cc802.jpg" >ANCEL Classic Enhanced Universal OBD II Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB01G5EA74I" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB01G5EA74I <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB01G5EA74I" >$21 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Easy-to-use keypad</li><li>Compact design</li><li>No battery required</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Low reader accuracy</li><li>Some compatibility issues</li></ul><p> The Ancel Classic OBD Scanner is easy to use, even for those uncomfortable working on cars. It works on most cars made in the U.S. after 1996 or in the EU or Asia after 2000 and supports multiple languages, including English, French, Spanish, Russian, and German. The large LCD has a white backlight to make it easy to read even in dim lighting.</p><p> If it turns out that your code isn’t serious, this device can turn off that annoying check engine light. The scanner comes with a 2.5-foot long, well-insulated cable that connects with your car’s OBDII data link connector; no other battery or charger is required as it powers up through that link. A three-year warranty means you can rest easy choosing this scanner.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> No |<strong>Built-in Display:</strong> Yes |<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.02”x6.34”x1.38” |<strong>Weight:</strong> 9.6 Oz</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134490/18498" target="_top" id="2134490">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134490" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134490/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Splurge"><a href="#Splurge" class="headerlink" title="Splurge"></a>Splurge</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" >BlueDriver Professional OBDII Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" >$100 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/415766460" >$120 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Works through a user-friendly app</li><li>Durable</li><li>Always stays plugged in</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Bluetooth connection can be a bit spotty</li><li>Pricey</li></ul><p> The BlueDriver OBDII Scanner isn’t the cheapest option out there, but seeing as it’s aimed at those who want more professional readings than you can get from all-in-one units, that’s to be expected. This tiny sensor, once installed, transmits codes, errors, and information via Bluetooth to the BlueDriver app. This app is the centerpiece of the whole unit, as it’s one of the most beautifully designed and full-featured pieces of software we’ve seen. You can call up codes, search them, and even set the app into HUD mode to treat it as an onboard meter.</p><p> What’s extra interesting about this is the 24&#x2F;7 support, meaning you can contact an actual human if you need more information on a particular reading. You can even have the app generate on-demand repair reports compiled and verified by certified technicians. These repair reports are pulled from a database of over 6.6 million vehicle-specific diagnostics, so chances are, you can pull one up for your specific vehicle.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Yes |<strong>Built-in Display:</strong> No |<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 2.2”x1.9”x1” |<strong>Weight:</strong> 2.08 Oz</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Car Code Reader"></a>What to Look For in a Car Code Reader</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975802/19272" target="_top" id="1975802">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975802" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975802/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Ease of Use"></a>Ease of Use</h3><p> If you haven’t had a car code reader before, purchase a simple one.

OBD2 is a universal interface in most cars introduced in the 1980s. While it won’t work on every old car out there, you should be covered as long as it is somewhat new. Almost all newer cars will support it.</li><li>Are car code readers worth it?<br> Car code readers are relatively inexpensive, making them a worthwhile investment if you want to pinpoint an issue with your vehicle without taking it to an expensive mechanic. A car code reader lets you read and clear codes, view basic parameter IDs, and check and reset readiness monitors. This gives you an excellent way to tell if the problem is something you can fix quickly before shelling out to a car shop, potentially saving you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars.</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-breaking-news-afbs-secret-to-trending-content/"><u>[Updated] Breaking News AFB's Secret to Trending Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-creating-immersive-video-games-experiences-on-steam-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Creating Immersive Video Games Experiences on Steam for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/bridge-the-gap-top-methods-to-reconnect-your-usb-wi-fi-on-pcs/"><u>Bridge the Gap: Top Methods to Reconnect Your USB Wi-Fi on PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-of-microsoft-surface-pro-7s-latest-iteration-solid-capabilities-and-subtle-upgrades/"><u>Expert Analysis of Microsoft Surface Pro 7'S Latest Iteration: Solid Capabilities and Subtle Upgrades</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/expert-insights-on-the-asus-ac68u-router-the-ultimate-blend-of-velocity-and-cybersecurity-in-5g/"><u>Expert Insights on the Asus AC68U Router - The Ultimate Blend of Velocity and Cybersecurity in 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-feasible-ways-to-fake-location-on-facebook-for-your-nokia-130-music-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 4 Feasible Ways to Fake Location on Facebook For your Nokia 130 Music | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-solutions-for-vivo-s17-unlock-without-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Solutions For Vivo S17 Unlock Without Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-detect-and-stop-mspy-from-spying-on-your-xiaomi-redmi-note-13-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Detect and Stop mSpy from Spying on Your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-sound-sculpting-on-android-the-7-ultimate-audio-editing-apps/"><u>In 2024, Sound Sculpting on Android The 7 Ultimate Audio Editing Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/in-depth-review-of-the-superior-byb-e430-led-lamp-with-swing-arm-mechanism-the-ultimate-guide-to-quality-lighting/"><u>In-Depth Review of the Superior BYB E430 LED Lamp with Swing Arm Mechanism - The Ultimate Guide to Quality Lighting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/mastering-outdoor-adventures-with-garmin-gpsmap-64st-an-in-depth-review/"><u>Mastering Outdoor Adventures with Garmin GPSMAP 64St: An In-Depth Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/maximizing-protection-with-urban-armor-gears-durable-macbook-pro-sleeve/"><u>Maximizing Protection with Urban Armor Gear's Durable MacBook Pro Sleeve</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/powershot-g9x2-adventure-and-classic-aesthetics/"><u>PowerShot G9X2: Adventure & Classic Aesthetics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/reinstall-your-drivers-with-device-manager-in-windows-10-by-drivereasy-guide/"><u>Reinstall your drivers with Device Manager in Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/the-complete-evaluation-of-zmis-mighty-20000mah-portable-charger/"><u>The Complete Evaluation of ZMI's Mighty 20,000mAh Portable Charger</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-checklist-for-buying-a-television/"><u>The Ultimate Checklist for Buying a Television</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-checklist-for-cross-verifying-health-recommendations-from-ai-entities-such-as-chatgpt/"><u>The Ultimate Checklist for Cross-Verifying Health Recommendations From AI Entities Such as ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/weatherproof-and-stunning-discover-the-powerful-performance-of-the-sunbrite-veranda-55-inch-tv-in-crystal-clear-4k/"><u>Weatherproof & Stunning: Discover the Powerful Performance of the SunBrite Veranda 55 Inch TV in Crystal Clear 4K</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/windows-11-arm-installation-made-simple-via-iso-download-guide/"><u>Windows 11 ARM Installation Made Simple via ISO Download Guide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

As much as I love my gaming laptops, both of my models, an Eluktronics and an MSI, both feel like they’re about to catch fire whenever I’m playing a heavy-hitting game like Division or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/destiny-2-4158011" >Destiny 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> A couple gaming sessions later, and I realized I needed a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cooling-pads-4149823" >laptop cooling pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . After taking a look at various models, I decided to try out the HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad. It boasts five fans and an adjustable rollout switch to customize my cooling experience. And it offers anti-slip baffles so my curious cat can’t knock it off my laptop. After over a year of use, I still use this almost every day for my gaming needs. Read on for our final verdict, as well as thoughts on its specs.</p><h2 id="Design-Looks-like-a-gamer’s-cooling-pad"><a href="#Design-Looks-like-a-gamer’s-cooling-pad" class="headerlink" title="Design: Looks like a gamer’s cooling pad"></a>Design: Looks like a gamer’s cooling pad</h2><p> HAVIT offers this laptop cooling pad in two different colors: red and blue. I personally felt that the red would be too bright and opted for the blue; when I pulled it out of the box, I was surprised at how heavy its 1.8 pounds felt in my hand.</p><p> On top of the pad itself, it comes with a braided USB cord for protection. It could plug into one of two ports, of which I used the spare to add USB charging for USB compatible items like my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-kindle-2019-review-4688850" >Amazon Kindle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jabra-talk-45-review-5070286" >Java Bluetooth headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J6RTKS-ZdzNqPyF_Tm9lloOF1iM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_04-5a7071fefb884ba19eb68638fdbf1b2b.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> To me, the design seems a little clunky. It has smooth edges, but it’s clearly designed as a gamer’s edgy laptop cooling pad with seemingly unnecessary grooves that serve only to hold dust. If you’re looking for a simple design, this is not your cooling pad. That being said, the metal mesh pad for air circulation can accommodate laptops ranging from 14 to 17 inches thanks to its 15.87 x 11.81 x 1.34 inches (LWH) in dimension.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484939/16446" target="_top" id="1484939">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484939" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484939/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Fans-Wasn’t-blown-away"><a href="#Fans-Wasn’t-blown-away" class="headerlink" title="Fans: Wasn’t blown away"></a>Fans: Wasn’t blown away</h2><p> I set up the cooling pad and flipped on the roller switch. HAVIT promises five quiet fans—one 110-millimeter fan, and four other strategically placed 85-millimeter fans. HAVIT holds true to its promise: This cooling pad emits a fairly faint sound I can’t hear through my Samsung Buds headphones, even with their noise cancelling features. The fans are so quiet that if I was gaming, I wasn’t able to hear them.</p><p> Without the laptop cooling pad, I was running around 187 degrees Fahrenheit. With the cooling pad, it adjusted to around 169 degrees.</p><p> Better yet, I could adjust the fans to customize how much air I wanted to circulate due to the roller switch HAVIT put as the on&#x2F;off switch. If I wasn’t sure about how much power I was putting into the fans, I could simply lift my laptop up from the pad; as I turned up the power, the blue LED lights in the cooling pad grew brighter.</p><p> Before getting this cooling pad, my Eluktronics laptop sounded like an airplane was taking off and landing at my desk space. I wish I could say that this changed after implementing the pad into my gaming rig, or even with my MSI laptop. Unfortunately, my laptops’ fans still sound like I’m on the tarmac instead of being at home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/l2nDOOm1dGSmniJBqJPn708DnK8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_03-71babed64c14425184604e4825680aac.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135369/19272" target="_top" id="2135369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135369/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> That’s not to say that this laptop cooling pad doesn’t help cool it down. Since my Eluktronics is getting some much-needed TLC in the shop, I tested the MSI’s internal temps while running<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tropico-6-review-5077604" >Tropico Six <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on my laptop. Without the laptop cooling pad, I was running around 187 degrees Fahrenheit. With the cooling pad, it adjusted to around 169 degrees. It’s not much, but it’s enough to make a difference.</p><h2 id="Baffles-Adjustable-for-gaming-and-typing"><a href="#Baffles-Adjustable-for-gaming-and-typing" class="headerlink" title="Baffles: Adjustable for gaming and typing"></a>Baffles: Adjustable for gaming and typing</h2><p> If you feel the laptop needs more circulation, the good news is that HAVIT also anticipated these needs, too. Anti-slip baffles offer a sturdy position on any desk, even if you push up the height to a more angled position.</p><p> There is a sturdy flap should you prefer the angled laptop pad, or if you prefer, a sturdier laptop placement while flat. I tested out the height adjustment for a little while, but ultimately decided against using them for personal preference instead of durability reasons.</p><p> To me, the design seems a little clunky. It has smooth edges, but it’s clearly designed as a gamer’s edgy laptop cooling pad with seemingly unnecessary grooves that serve only to hold dust.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hXjExslBR5KBA1RSMPFlkkvF1uQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_02-f065f40118184391b6f1ba1bffa763bd.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> And, if you’re on-the-go and travelling, the HAVIT 5 also packs quite nicely into a suitcase. Be sure to play it safe like I did and pack it around clothes. But if you need to go across country and want to take your gaming laptop with you, this is a good one that will hold up well in luggage.</p><h2 id="Price-Ouch"><a href="#Price-Ouch" class="headerlink" title="Price: Ouch"></a>Price: Ouch</h2><p> I picked up my HAVIT 5 while it was on sale for around $30 back in 2019, but the usual price is around $50. That seems a little steep, especially for fans that don’t necessarily pack the punch for gaming that most laptops require. If you keep an eye on Amazon, you can usually get this one for around $30, as it seems to go on sale fairly often.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lItC7F6Ja8RbBfTaNXh5l9ufFqY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_05-07577b69f7d04de5a7904e798681ba02-6b3615a38d584594b89077eaf51228b2.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118325/7443" target="_top" id="2118325">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118325" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118325/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="HAVIT-5-vs-Kootak-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#HAVIT-5-vs-Kootak-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="HAVIT 5 vs. Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>HAVIT 5 vs. Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> It makes sense to compare the Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad to the HAVIT. Both have five cooling fans, both fit laptops up to 17 inches, and both offer anti-slip baffles to ensure your laptop is safe if you want to adjust the height for more air circulation or wrist angle preferences. The key differences are design and adjustability.</p><p> While the HAVIT is clearly a gaming laptop cooling pad, the Kootak features smooth edges and has a more universal aesthetic to its design. The Kootak is also cheaper, at around $37. If you prefer a true gaming cooling pad, go with the HAVIT. If you don’t care about aesthetics and prefer to be cost conscious, the Kootak will be better suited to your needs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Good, but could be great.</strong></p><p> It’s not the best out there, but so long as it cools the internal laptop core temperatures by about 20 degrees, it’s a worthy investment. Props go to HAVIT for giving it a roller switch for ultimate adjustability and an LED light that will show how high the fans are blowing.

Keep reading for the full product review.</em></p><p> The new MacBook Pro 16-inch M1 is the best laptop Apple has ever produced.</p><p> The combination of terrific display, incredible speed, and stellar battery life make the Pro a must-buy for anyone who depends on their laptop to speed through demanding computing tasks. Of course, this level of performance comes with a high price tag, starting at $2499. The MacBook Pro offers a window into a new kind of computing experience for those who can stomach the hefty price.</p><p> I’ve been using Apple portables ever since the Powerbook 100 was released in 1991. After spending several weeks with the new MacBook Pro, it offers the responsiveness previously associated only with iPads and iPhones, matched with the refined form factor of Apple’s best laptops.</p><h2 id="Design-Back-to-the-future"><a href="#Design-Back-to-the-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Back to the future"></a>Design: Back to the future</h2><p> On the surface, the new MacBook Pro doesn’t look radically different from Apple’s previous Pro laptop models. It’s got a similar aluminum case, and the screen is about the same size as the 2019 model.</p><p> However, the tiny details make all the difference in the design of the new MacBook. The Pro just feels nicer than any laptop Apple has ever made in many different ways starting with the incredibly smooth hinge mechanism when you open it up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dFndxams3xUoua0_gkYqRycgBdU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/macbook-pro-1-db37ffedba744e8eb2070780c0d8de10.jpg"                      alt="Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M1, 2021)"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Sascha Brodsky</p><p> The Pro could be considered a step back in some areas. For one thing, at 0.66 by 14 by 9.8 inches and 4.8 pounds, the MacBook Pro is chunkier and heavier than the model it replaces. This is definitely not a laptop you’ll forget you are carrying in your backpack. On the other hand, the heft of the new MacBook is reassuring and in keeping with its target market of professionals.</p><p> Apple has also gone full circle and replaced the ports it removed in previous iterations of the MacBook. You get a MagSafe connector, headphone jack, SD card slot, HDMI port, and three Thunderbolt 4 ports, which should be enough for almost any user. There’s no USB-A port but most people won’t miss it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080312/19272" target="_top" id="2080312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080312/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Keyboard-Precision-is-everything"><a href="#Keyboard-Precision-is-everything" class="headerlink" title="Keyboard: Precision is everything"></a>Keyboard: Precision is everything</h2><p> The joy of using the MacBook Pro really becomes apparent when you start typing on the keyboard. It’s got a scissor key mechanism that feels precise and offers excellent feedback.</p><p> Apple has ditched the Touch Bar, a strip that allows touch access to software functions.</p><p> The Pro has one of the best keyboards I’ve ever used on a laptop. But If I’m going to be picky, I would say that the key resistance is a little too strong, which can lead to finger fatigue during extended typing sessions.</p><p> Just above the keyboard is another area where Apple has decided to go backward. The company has ditched the Touch Bar, a strip that allows touch access to software functions. As someone who used the Touch Bar for several years and never found a use for it, I say good riddance.</p><h2 id="Trackpad-Big-and-bold"><a href="#Trackpad-Big-and-bold" class="headerlink" title="Trackpad: Big and bold"></a>Trackpad: Big and bold</h2><p> There’s nothing not to like about the trackpad on the new MacBook Pro. It’s big and responsive, and you won’t notice it after a while, which is all you need in an input device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tD3rxlw9zH5xufV5ztJIZyrJc3Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/macbook-pro-3-db6300639d8049d1862d0e4f25a35222.jpg"                      alt="Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M1, 2021)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135407/19272" target="_top" id="2135407">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135407" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135407/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Sascha Brodsky</p><p> The new MacBook’s trackpad works perfectly, which is more than you can about the one on most Windows laptops. I had no trouble flicking the cursor accurately around the screen when spending hours editing documents.</p><h2 id="Display-Bright-and-beautiful"><a href="#Display-Bright-and-beautiful" class="headerlink" title="Display: Bright and beautiful"></a>Display: Bright and beautiful</h2><p> The Pro sports the best display I’ve ever used on any computer and might be a reason to buy this model all by itself. It screams quality.</p><p> Some users might object to the notch carved out at the top of the display, making room for a camera. But I found that I didn’t even notice the gap after using the Pro for a few hours.</p><p> Along with the glorious display, you get a newly redesigned set of speakers with the Pro.</p><p> The display offers Mini-LED technology, which means that the display can turn off in sections, giving you deeper black levels than regular LED displays. You also get ProMotion which means a high refresh rate for a smoother look when you do things like moving the mouse.</p><p> Along with the glorious display, you get a newly redesigned set of speakers with the Pro. The speakers are, in a word, terrific. They offer four woofers, which bang out sufficient bass to make most music sound lively. Movies sound close to theater quality.</p><p> Text looks terrific on the Pro, and I ended up spending time gazing at Word documents just to admire the way words look so crisp and defined. Video playback was equally impressive, with the Mini-LED screen revealing a level of detail that made me want to rewatch my favorite movies. The no-glare coating also works very well, even when using the Pro in direct sunlight.</p><h2 id="Performance-Sizzling-speed-that-stays-cool"><a href="#Performance-Sizzling-speed-that-stays-cool" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Sizzling speed that stays cool"></a>Performance: Sizzling speed that stays cool</h2><p> The MacBook Pro uses the same cutting-edge M1 chip, designed by Apple, that’s been powering some of the company’s other machines over the past year.</p><p> The new chip makes all the difference. I never thought my old MacBook Pro from 2019 was slow until I started using the new model, and now I can’t try any other computer without thinking how sluggish it is.</p><p> Apps start nearly instantly on the Pro. I have a bad habit of keeping too many browser tabs open while I’m working. But even when I had dozens of tabs open in both the Chrome and Safari web browsers, the Pro didn’t slow down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UM5_acSqOhRJtIaZE3CeAWp45y0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/macbook-pro-2-2be1639ee44f489286cb43a53aaf6454.jpg"                      alt="Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M1, 2021)"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Sascha Brodsky</p><p> For those who want to know the details, the PCMark benchmarking software found the following scores for the MacBook Pro:</p><p> Single Core: 1749</p><p> Multi-Core: 11542</p><p> By way of comparison, here are the results of the same testing software on the MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1):</p><p> Single Core: 1720</p><p> Multi-Core: 7552</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975836/19272" target="_top" id="1975836">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975836" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975836/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Keeps-on-going-and-going"><a href="#Battery-Keeps-on-going-and-going" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Keeps on going and going"></a>Battery: Keeps on going and going</h2><p> One of the benefits of the new M1 chip is its efficiency. Despite its power, the chip sips energy. The M1 Pro ran for 16 hours on its battery during continuous use, making it the longest-lasting laptop I’ve ever tried.</p><p> There’s a significant practical gain from all this battery life. Essentially you don’t need to worry about bringing along a charger, even for a full day’s work. It’s a liberating feeling not having to worry about juice.</p><p> The M1 Pro ran for 16 hours during continuous use, making it the longest-lasting laptop I’ve ever tried.</p><p> Another nice thing about the efficient M1 chip is the fact that the MacBook runs cool. I’ve used it for dozens of hours, and it never felt more than slightly warm. Contrast that to my 2019 MacBook Pro that used to get so hot I was worried it would catch fire.</p><h2 id="Price-Cough-splutter"><a href="#Price-Cough-splutter" class="headerlink" title="Price: Cough, splutter?"></a>Price: Cough, splutter?</h2><p> The big hiccup for most potential users of the MacBook Pro is its high price tag. I’ve been using the lowest-end model, which starts at $2499. You get a 10-Core CPU, 16-Core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD Storage for that price.</p><p> To put that into perspective, you can buy the excellent<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macbook-pro-13-inch-m1-2020-review-5092658" >MacBook Air, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which also has an M1 chip for $999. The Air at that price point comes with an 8 core CPU, 7 core GPU, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD storage.</p><p> I use my MacBook for hours every day for critical tasks, so spending big doesn’t phase me. I plan to keep the new Pro model for years and make sure I have a relatively futureproof setup.</p><p> A less expensive MacBook will be just fine for many users who just need a light work and fun machine. But for anyone who wants arguably the best laptop ever made, only the new MacBook Pro will do.</p><h2 id="MacBook-Pro-M1-2021-vs-MacBook-Air-M1-2020"><a href="#MacBook-Pro-M1-2021-vs-MacBook-Air-M1-2020" class="headerlink" title="MacBook Pro (M1, 2021) vs. MacBook Air (M1, 2020)"></a>MacBook Pro (M1, 2021) vs. MacBook Air (M1, 2020)</h2><p> There’s an excellent case to be made that for many people, the much less expensive MacBook Air is a better option than the Pro model.</p><p> The Air offers many of the same benefits as the Pro, including the screaming fast M1 processor, which also means a very long battery life. You also get the tried and tested portability of the Air model, which makes it significantly slimmer and lighter than the Pro.</p><p> But the Pro model does have many advantages over the air, and it’s a question of deciding whether they are enough for you to pay the extra money. For example, the Pro comes with many ports that can be handy for hooking up peripherals, whereas with the Air, you are pretty much stuck with USB-C.</p><p> The screen of the 16-inch MacBook Pro is also leaps and bounds ahead of the Air model. The Pro display is much larger than the Air, of course, which means that you can see a lot more information at a time and can make working with large documents or spreadsheets easier. The screen also blows away the Air in terms of sharpness and resolution, which you’ll instantly notice if you have the two models side by side.</p><p> If your main computing tasks are light web browsing and you value portability over raw power, the Air is a solid choice. But if you spend many hours a day looking at your laptop’s screen and want the flexibility of lots of ports, you won’t regret spending the extra cash on the Pro.  </p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An incredibly powerful laptop.</strong></p><p> As one of the newest and more expensive laptops on the market, it’s no surprise that I’m giving the MacBook Pro top marks in practice. Blazing speed, a great screen, and all day and then some battery life make this a great laptop for almost any use. However, the design is back to the basics and road warriors might want to consider a lighter, less bulky model. But, if you depend on your MacBook for demanding tasks, this is a must-buy.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macbook-pro-13-inch-m1-2020-review-5092658" >Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1, 2020) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macbook-air-13-inch-m1-2020-review-5092793" >Apple MacBook Air 13-inch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-xps-13-7390-2-in-1-review-5113106" >Dell XPS 13 7390 (2020) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047411/19272" target="_top" id="2047411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047411/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021)</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>MPN  MK183LL&#x2F;A</li><li>Release Date  October 2021</li><li>Weight  4.7 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  14.01 x 9.77 x 0.66 in.</li><li>Color  Silver, Space Gray</li><li>Price  Starting at $2,499</li><li>Warranty  1 year (limited)</li><li>Platform  macOS Monterey</li><li>Processor  Apple M1 Pro chip or Apple M1 Max chip, 10-core CPU, up to 32-core GPU</li><li>RAM  Up to 64GB</li><li>Storage  Up to 8TB</li><li>Camera  1080p</li><li>Battery Life  Up to 21 hours</li><li>Ports  3x Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C), HDMI, SDXC card slot</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-advanced-5-internet-screen-grabbers/"><u>[New] Advanced 5 Internet Screen Grabbers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-top-10-unique-gaming-screen-capture-applications-for-2024/"><u>[New] Top 10 Unique Gaming Screen Capture Applications for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-maximizing-clarity-4-steps-to-perfectly-capture-fb-video-calls/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Maximizing Clarity 4 Steps to Perfectly Capture FB Video Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-polka-dotted-parakeet-party/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Polka-Dotted Parakeet Party</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-screen-savants-a-comprehensive-guide-to-hd-recorders-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Screen Savants A Comprehensive Guide to HD Recorders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-the-ideal-whatsapp-ringtone-ios-and-android-guide/"><u>2024 Approved Crafting the Ideal WhatsApp Ringtone -

The downside of this arrangement is that they usually charge you a monthly equipment rental fee which might seem small on paper but adds up over time. The Motorola MG7700 is a modem and router combo that can put your ISP’s unit to shame with four gigabit-capable LAN ports, dual-band Wi-Fi, and user-friendly setup.</p><p> We recently reviewed the MG7700 to examine just how well it would perform in an average home environment by evaluating the design, ease of setup, network speeds, and software features.</p><h2 id="Design-Simple-and-functional"><a href="#Design-Simple-and-functional" class="headerlink" title="Design: Simple and functional"></a>Design: Simple and functional</h2><p> The Motorola MG7700 is fairly compact at 9.1 x 2.6 x 2.6 inches with a gray finish and a black stand. On the front of the device, you’ll find several indicator lights that tell you if it’s powered up, whether any traffic is flowing through your network, and if people are connected to your wireless network. The light indicators are easy to see and understand — something you don’t typically find in a modem from your cable company.</p><p> The MG7700 has a power port on the back, as well as a coaxial port for connecting your service provider’s cable to the device.

With more devices like smart home hubs requiring you to plug in with Ethernet, it would have been nice to see a few more LAN ports on the back.</p><p> One thing you’ll want to keep in mind that the modem’s stand makes the nine-inch box best suited for vertical placement. You can still place it on the side but it makes for a rather untidy appearance.</p><p> The Best Cable Modems on the Market</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130887/7443" target="_top" id="2130887">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130887" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130887/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Location-location-location"><a href="#Setup-Process-Location-location-location" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Location, location, location"></a>Setup Process: Location, location, location</h2><p> Since the Motorola MG7700 is a combined cable modem and router, you’ll need to plug it into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/introduction-to-network-cables-817868" >your ISP’s coaxial cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to pipe Internet into your home. This can limit your placement locations a bit since coax cables are often installed by your provider in less-than-ideal locations, especially if you live in an apartment building.</p><p> The router offered a strong Wi-Fi signal on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands on both floors of our home.</p><p> If you do get the choice of where it’s installed, you usually want the coax cable to come in from an unobtrusive corner, not sprouting out from the middle of the living room in an unsightly fashion. Unfortunately, that’s bad for routers which work best in a central location of your house or apartment so the signal covers everywhere you need. If you can’t get find a good spot away from other wireless devices, metal, walls, and other barriers that can impede signal, you may want to invest in a coax cable extension.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RfuGGYo_UZvzWOQw8Rb7KZnMkhs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-1-5c8faf2dc9e77c00014a9db2.jpg"                      alt="Motorola 7700"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Claire Cohen</p><p> A last but vital thing to know: Motorola’s branding for the device makes clear that it’s designed for Comcast Xfinity, Cox, and Spectrum. If you don’t use one of those ISP carriers, your modem won’t work on the network.</p><p> Information about approved third-party equipment can usually be found on your cable provider’s website. If not, it’s best to call and ask before you buy. We were able to set it up on Spectrum without any trouble.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-The-latest-standards"><a href="#Connectivity-The-latest-standards" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: The latest standards"></a>Connectivity: The latest standards</h2><p> The Motorola MG7700 is a 24x8 DOCSIS 3.0 modem that doubles as a wireless router. It has 24 downstream channels (which are lanes that handle network traffic, so the more, the better) allowing it to potentially hit a 1 Gbps download speed. There are eight upstream channels for a maximum 246 Mbps upload. This is a pretty standard set of connectivity protocols that makes it a lot faster than 16x4 modems, but slower than 32x8 ones.</p><p> And while actual speeds will depend heavily on what your cable provider offers, we tested the modem on Spectrum’s 100 Mbps plan, so although the MG7700 may be advertised to be capable of 1 Gbps download, we never actually hit it. In fact, Motorola cautions that the device is realistically recommended for actual downstream service of 650 Mbps. But since relatively few people are taking advantage of gigabit Internet today (unless you’re gaming, probably), the 24x8 should serve fine for the vast majority of users.</p><p> We found that it delivered outstanding speeds, maxing out our 100Mbps Spectrum plan when hard-wired via the LAN ports.</p><p> As for the router, it’s AC1900. The “AC” means it has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> support, allowing it to beam wireless signals over two frequencies: 2.4GHz and 5GHz. The 2.4GHz band is slower but has a longer range, while the 5GHz band is faster and less prone to interference from other wireless devices compared with the 2.4GHz band, but this comes at the cost of shorter range. These days, most devices support dual-band Wi-Fi and you can select which band you want to connect to.</p><p> Some advice: It’s often best to connect things such as smart switches and smart bulbs to the 2.4GHz band since they tend to be scattered across the house and reserve the 5GHz one for more bandwidth-hungry devices such as streaming sticks, game consoles, and TVs.</p><p> The “1900” represents the maximum theoretical bandwidth the router is capable of. In this case, the MG7700 could hit 1,900 Mbps, but again, this is only if your cable provider supports it, not to mention other factors like wireless interference due to congested bands and throttling from your provider.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100530/7443" target="_top" id="2100530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100530/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Performance-Fast-speeds-with-a-caveat"><a href="#Network-Performance-Fast-speeds-with-a-caveat" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Fast speeds with a caveat"></a>Network Performance: Fast speeds with a caveat</h2><p> Once we got the modem up and running, it delivered outstanding speeds, reliably maxing out our 100 Mbps Spectrum plan when we were hard-wired via the LAN ports.</p><p> When we went wireless, performance varied greatly. As mentioned before, you’ll want to try to place the modem in an area where you can reach the greatest number of devices around your home. But, if like us, you were forced to put the router in an area that isn’t ideal because of coax cable limitations, your wireless signal won’t go as far as you might like.</p><p> Overall, if you live in a large apartment or a modestly-sized home, you won’t be disappointed by the performance of the MG7700.</p><p> We tested the Motorola MG7700 in our 4,500-square-foot home while connected to a couple dozen devices (tablets, gaming consoles, computers, smartphones, etc.). The router offered a strong Wi-Fi signal on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands on both floors of our home. Everything from surfing the Web to streaming video was solid within an approximate 2,000-square-foot radius. In the basement and more distant locations of the house, the signal was weak, but that’s to be expected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pHbG256tJv_ubRtv-HdKUka66IA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-3-5c8fb059c9e77c0001a926bf.jpg"                      alt="Motorola MG7700"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Claire Cohen</p><p> If you have a large home like us and need stronger, more reliable speeds for numerous devices, some routers come with tri-band instead of the dual-band technology you’ll find in the MG7700. These routers have an extra 5GHz band which translates to faster speeds, more bandwidth, and the ability to connect more devices at the same time. You can also purchase a Wi-Fi extender, so your signal can extend and reach all the dead areas, but those are sometimes finicky to set up.</p><p> Overall, if you live in a large apartment or a modestly-sized home, you won’t be disappointed by the performance of the MG7700.</p><h2 id="Software-User-friendly-options"><a href="#Software-User-friendly-options" class="headerlink" title="Software: User-friendly options"></a>Software: User-friendly options</h2><p> The MG7700’s built-in software is customizable, too. Once your router is set up, you can go to a specified IP address (the instructions will tell you which one) in your Web browser to change settings, including the name of the default network, enabling password protection, toggling the channels your router will communicate on, and more. There’s also an Advanced page that allows you to set up a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-firewall-817568" >firewall <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or enable parental controls. Overall, the settings are well laid out, easy to understand, and simple to change.</p><h2 id="Price-Good-value-for-the-speed"><a href="#Price-Good-value-for-the-speed" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good value for the speed"></a>Price: Good value for the speed</h2><p> At $189.99 (MSRP), the MG7700 isn’t quite as a cheap as standalone modems, which can cost as little as $30, but incorporating both a modem and router into one device makes the price more palatable.</p><p> Overall, if you live in a large apartment or a modestly-sized home, you won’t be disappointed by the performance of the MG7700.</p><p> Taking into account the fact that your service providers rental fees can run to $10 to $12 a month, the MG7700 could pay for itself in a little over the year. And the price isn’t unusual for the market, other bestselling modem and router units such as the $199.99 TP-Link Archer CR1900 will cost you about the same for a similar set of capabilities.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006919/19272" target="_top" id="2006919">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006919" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006919/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Motorola-MG7700-vs-TP-Link-Archer-CR1900"><a href="#Motorola-MG7700-vs-TP-Link-Archer-CR1900" class="headerlink" title="Motorola MG7700 vs. TP-Link Archer CR1900"></a>Motorola MG7700 vs. TP-Link Archer CR1900</h2><p> The Motorola MG7700 has some close competition, chief among them is TP-Link Archer CR1900 modem&#x2F;router.

The four external active antennas are chunky, evocative of their impressive power, and decked out with soothing blue LEDs.</p><p> A row of LED indicators marches across the angled front surface of the router, easily readable whether wall-mounted or left on your desk, providing visual confirmation of data transfer from the internet, over each wireless band and the guest network, each USB port, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-fast-is-ethernet-817549" >10G connection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and each individual Ethernet connection.</p><p> Most of the connectors are located around back, along with a physical switch to turn off the LEDs on the antennas. For connectors, you get an Ethernet jack for connecting to your modem, six individual Ethernet jacks to connect other devices, a 10G LAN SFP+ connector, power input, and a physical power switch.</p><p> Two USB 3.0 type A connectors can be found on the left side of the router as you look at it from the front.

Unlike most routers, the Nighthawk X10 comes completely assembled. Each antenna comes sheathed in a bit of protective plastic, but even that slips right off. The router is basically ready to go right out of the box, which is a big time saver.</p><p> A lot of routers I test require a modem reboot, which is a bit of a pain as my network is set up with the modem and router in different rooms. The Nighthawk X10 AD7200 required no such reboot. I was able to launch Netgear’s routerlogin.net site as soon as I plugged in the Ethernet cable, and the setup process was almost entirely automated after that.</p><p> The Nighthawk X10 did require a firmware update as soon as I got it set up, but that only took a couple of minutes. You’ll also have to budget some extra time if you want to dig into additional features, like the built-in Plex Media Server, but the basic setup process is over really fast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RfTANl22rAcY7Xy986eYa_62r44=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_WirelessRouters_NighthawkX10AD7200_02-1721b933d315435f98631847bf3ebb0b.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 (R9000)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Connectivity-AD7200-tri-band-with-MU-MIMO-and-10G-SFP"><a href="#Connectivity-AD7200-tri-band-with-MU-MIMO-and-10G-SFP" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: AD7200 tri-band with MU-MIMO and 10G SFP+"></a><strong>Connectivity: AD7200 tri-band with MU-MIMO and 10G SFP+</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 is an AD7200 tri-band router, which means it’s capable of providing 1733Mbps over a 5GHz wireless network, 800Mbps over a 2.4GHz network, and a blistering 4600Mbps over a 60Hz network. That last one is the key feature here, as only 802.11ad routers like this one feature a super-high-speed 60GHz network.</p><p> If you aren’t familiar with 802.11ad, it’s a completely different standard from the more common 802.11ax. While 802.11ax is the successor to 802.11ac, the 802.11ad standard found in this router is a specialized offshoot that offers extremely high speeds and very short distances.</p><p> Also referred to as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/introduction-to-60-ghz-wireless-network-protocols-817936" >WiGig <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> due to its high speeds, 802.11ad supports speeds of up to 7Gbps and transmission distances of up to 30 feet when beamforming is employed, but real-world performance typically maxes out around 15 to 20 feet, and can’t pass through walls or other obstructions.</p><p> In addition to the 60GHz WiGig band, this router also creates simultaneous 5GHz and 2.4GHz networks for your devices that don’t support WiGig, which is likely to be either most or all of them.</p><p> In addition to the 60GHz WiGig band, this router also creates simultaneous 5GHz and 2.4GHz networks for your devices that don’t support WiGig, which is likely to be either most or all of them.</p><p> For physical connectivity, the Nighthawk X10 features six Ethernet ports, two of which can be used together to create a single 2Gbps connection. You also get two USB 3.0 ports for connecting USB drives and a single 10Gbps SFP+ LAN port. This final port is potentially the most interesting, and also most niche since it allows you to connect a high-speed NAS server, a secondary switch for more Ethernet ports, or other devices that require a bunch of high-speed bandwidth.</p><h2 id="Network-Performance-Fantastic-5GHz-performance-WiGig-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired"><a href="#Network-Performance-Fantastic-5GHz-performance-WiGig-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Fantastic 5GHz performance, WiGig leaves a bit to be desired"></a><strong>Network Performance: Fantastic 5GHz performance, WiGig leaves a bit to be desired</strong></h2><p> Since this is an 802.11ad router, and the 60GHz WiGig network is the key feature here, that’s where I’m going to start. All of my tests are performed using a 1Gbps Mediacom cable internet connection, so any testing done on an 802.11ad router like this involves data transfer speeds within my network, not the internet connection. For testing purposes, I have a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that I retrofitted with a network interface card featuring the QCA9005 chipset.</p><p> Using my test laptop, I was able to connect to the Nighthawk X10’s 60GHz network and measure speeds that topped out at 4.6Gbps. The issue is that in order to maintain a solid connection and record connection speeds anywhere close to 4.6Gbps, I had to place the router on the desk right next to the laptop.</p><p> With the router in its normal position, just a few feet away from my desk, I was only able to manage a transfer speed of a little bit over 1Gbps. Moving my test laptop a bit further away resulted in a dip to barely 300Mbps, and the connection struggled to work at all at a distance of 10 feet with no obstructions.</p><p> The bottom line is that this router provides truly awesome speeds at very short distances, but the benefit falls off sharply, and you’d be better off using the 5GHz network even a few feet away.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Jwl6BD38cWznmN0op6bpzAmBs_U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_WirelessRouters_NighthawkX10AD7200_03-4cfe683a7cf94e94b14c0ec2be12da50.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 (R9000)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> To the Nighthawk X10’s credit, the 5GHz network performance exceeded my wildest expectations. Using my 1Gbps Mediacom cable internet connection, I measured a relatively mediocre 373Mbps down and 73.6Mbps up. At the same time, using a wired connection to the same router, I measured 536.8Mbps down.</p><p> Moving about 10 feet away from the router, with a closed-door in the way, the download speed increased to 405Mbps, with 62Mbps up. At about 50 feet out, with several walls, appliances, and pieces of furniture in the way, the connection held strong at 310Mbps down and 49.6Mbps up. That’s one of the best results I’ve seen out of all the 5GHz routers I’ve tested.</p><p> For my final test, I took my phone down to my garage at a distance of about 100 feet, with an unreasonable amount of obstructions between the router and the device. At this distance, most routers fail to connect at all, struggle to maintain a connection, or kick me to the 2.4GHz band.</p><p> The Nighthawk X10 held strong though, dropping the download speed to 38.8Mbps and the upload speed to 13.1Mbps, but without touching the ping, barely increasing jitter, and introducing just 1.2 percent packet loss. Strangely enough, this 802.11ad router’s strongest selling point might be the impressively robust nature of its 5GHz network.</p><p> Strangely enough, this 802.11ad router’s strongest selling point might be the impressively robust nature of its 5 GHz network.</p><h2 id="Software-Netgear’s-web-interface-and-web-app-plus-Plex-and-more"><a href="#Software-Netgear’s-web-interface-and-web-app-plus-Plex-and-more" class="headerlink" title="Software: Netgear’s web interface and web app, plus Plex and more"></a><strong>Software: Netgear’s web interface and web app, plus Plex and more</strong></h2><p> Like its other offerings, Netgear gives you the option to manage the Nighthawk X10 using a web interface or a smartphone app. I used the web interface, and I found it fairly easy to understand and navigate if a bit slow.</p><p> The web portal provides you with basic and advanced tabs, with the basic tab giving you a big picture overview of the router’s status. It shows whether or not the internet is connected, the status of your wireless networks, how many devices are attached, and then gives you a bit of information on the status of the parental controls, the ReadySHARE feature for connecting USB drives, and your guest network.</p><p> Digging into advanced settings is more complicated, and you may find yourself reaching for documentation to find some options that are buried beneath several levels of menus.</p><p> Beyond the basics, this router comes with Plex Media Server built right in, and you can access and configure it through the main Netgear web portal. The way it works is that you can plug storage media into the Nighthawk X10 via the USB ports or the 10G SFP+ port and then stream media directly to Plex clients.</p><p> Aside from the robust 5GHz network, the built-in Plex server is definitely the strongest feature included with this router.

For the money you’d spend on this router, you could get a high-end 802.11ax router.</p><p> If you do have use for an 802.11ad router, then $250 isn’t that bad of a price tag, especially considering the fantastic 5GHz performance and the convenient inclusion of Plex Media Server. I wouldn’t recommend upgrading your existing equipment to 802.11ad just to use this router, but the Nighthawk X10 makes a fine choice if you already have the hardware to support it.</p><p> By way of comparison, the Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR700 has similar specifications, swaps out Plex Media Server for some gaming-centric quality of life (QoL) features, and has a street price that’s close to $400.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111968/7443" target="_top" id="2111968">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111968" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111968/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-X10-AD7200-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-RAX80"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-X10-AD7200-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-RAX80" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 vs. Netgear Nighthawk RAX80"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 vs. Netgear Nighthawk RAX80</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $400, and a street price closer to $350, the Nighthawk RAX80 (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MQDZXA4?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846418%7Cnd55a891e250641509ef77229001ead8021%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is in the same general territory as the Nighthawk X10. The big difference between these competing Nighthawk devices is that one is an 802.11ad router, and the other is an 802.11ax router.</p><p> In terms of real-world 5GHz performance, the Nighthawk X10 actually blows the Nighthawk RAX80 out of the water. It’s important to note that testing was done with 802.11ac devices that couldn’t take full advantage of the Nighthawk RAX80’s full capabilities, but I measured significantly slower speeds from the Nighthawk RAX80 in my 50-foot test, and it wasn’t even able to maintain a 5GHz connection at all in my garage.</p><p> The bottom line here is that the Nighthawk X10 is remarkably good with 5GHz 802.11ac devices, and it’s a good choice if you have 802.11ad devices, but the Nighthawk RAX80 is a better value looking into the future since it supports 802.11ax.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Strong 5GHz performance and Plex Media Center make this a good option if you need an 802.11ad router.</strong></p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 is a bit of a mixed bag since its key feature is so niche. If you really need an 802.11ad router, you may want to look for one with a stronger range. However, this router has fantastic performance on the 5GHz band, and the Plex Media Server implementation is also a very strong plus. If short-range 802.11ad support with excellent fallback 5GHz performance sounds good to you, then this is the router you’re looking for.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk X10 AD7200 Router</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>SKU  R9000</li><li>Price  $499.99</li><li>Weight  4.11 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.8 x 6.6 x 2.9 in.</li><li>Speed  60GHz: 4,600Mbps;

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition packs all the functionality of an Amazon Fire TV streaming device right into its chassis. This 55-inch LED smart TV combines affordability with Alexa, Amazon Prime content, and access to over 500,000 episodes across your favorite streaming platforms. We thoroughly tested the Toshiba’s picture quality, display settings, and the Fire OS interface and usability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pCLBMqSK1Hi3ePW2jzUkDycA2IU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_04-f1f62a55ea504fc9aa98fc9e14527ba7.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Best-for-a-bigger-room"><a href="#Design-Best-for-a-bigger-room" class="headerlink" title="Design: Best for a bigger room"></a><strong>Design: Best for a bigger room</strong></h2><p> The Toshiba 55-inch Fire TV is not a small device. While it only weighs 31.3 pounds with the stand (though the stand itself weighs less than a pound), it’s both tall and wide enough to make moving and installing it a two-person job. The TV’s dimensions with the stand are 27.8 inches tall, 44.6 inches wide, and 10.7 inches deep, and the screen size (on a diagonal) measures at 49.5 inches.</p><p> There’s no wall mount included in the box, but there are four standard VESA mounting holes on the back of the unit for safe and easy installation. In a smaller space, wall-mounting this television might not be a bad idea. Even in the relatively modestly-sized room where we tested the TV, it nearly completely took up the entire shelf where we placed it and a broad swath of the wall behind it. This TV is not particularly thin and actually tends to be a bit bulky in the very back of the unit, and the stand also adds width. The legs splay out and require a wide, long surface to accommodate them.</p><p> An attractive option for shoppers who want a smart 4K TV under $500.</p><p> The other important component is the Alexa-enabled remote, which is small, lightweight, and contains a circular dial with directional controls and play&#x2F;pause functionality. You also have the benefit of summoning Alexa with the touch of the speaker button, which is intuitively placed at the top of the remote (though we often accidentally hit it when we were trying to push the Home button, which is right below it).</p><p> The buttons are clearly laid out on the remote, and it’s convenient to have volume and mute controls in addition to a shortcut button to antenna channels. There are also some shortcut buttons as well: Prime Video, Nextflix, HBO, and Vue.</p><p> There are some downsides to the remote’s overall quality. Unlike other Fire TV remotes that create a completely smooth and seamless effect on the back, this remote is a lot more traditional, with a tab for pulling off the battery cover. It makes an unfortunate creaking noise almost every time you push a button, and while it never fell off the noise was distracting and contributed to the plastic and flimsy feel of the remote.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/bohXBE5CBPeYtI5seooxoQhyzkY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_02-781cfad0cacf41878e3ffb24afd56c6e.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Quick and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Quick and easy</strong></h2><p> There is a little setup required out of the box, whether you wall mount it or attach the stand. We chose the latter and found the instructions to be straightforward. Each leg requires both a longer 35 mm screw to help create a secure attachment to the bottom of the TV and two 10 mm screws that secure the legs to the back of the unit.</p><p> Installing the legs isn’t complicated, but it can be awkward because you need to place the TV screen-side down on a soft or cushioned surface. It helps to have a bit of space to do this either on a sofa or a clean, carpeted area, and maybe a helping hand to situate the TV wherever you plan to put it.</p><p> Once the legs were in place, we placed the TV on a table and plugged in the power cord. The TV powered on immediately and we were prompted to press the play&#x2F;pause button on the remote to begin setup.</p><p> We were guided through a quick process of connecting to Wi-Fi, signing in with Amazon account credentials, and registering the TV to our account. While you can enjoy this television without an existing Amazon account, you will have to create one in order to complete setup and gain access to all apps. The whole setup only takes a few moments, though, and we were on the Home screen of the Fire OS interface before we knew it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Gg5qCbaSxBZF2n4hLJ-UWMjX7vk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_05-ea81ea03abde49c3856c921f1321d024.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135365/19272" target="_top" id="2135365">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135365" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135365/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crisp-but-sometimes-needs-tweaking"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crisp-but-sometimes-needs-tweaking" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crisp but sometimes needs tweaking"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crisp but sometimes needs tweaking</strong></h2><p> While setting up the TV was very fast and took only a few minutes, we did have to spend some time adjusting the picture settings. Unfortunately, this is not something the online user manual provides much insight about.</p><p> We headed straight for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> content on Amazon Prime and played a number of movies and TV series. What we found was that it consistently took about a minute for the picture to kick into Ultra HD<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The default standard picture settings yielded an incredibly dark picture with too much contrast. The reds were very exaggerated and the low-light scenes, especially scenes at night, were very difficult to see.</p><p> Accessing the HDR picture settings is not exactly intuitive. Long-pressing the Home button on the remote brings up a shortcut menu and that’s where we were able to access HDR picture settings. Picture settings can be found under Display and Sounds in the main Settings menu, but there’s only a blanket setting for all app and video content. Settings that work for regular HD content, which was the majority of the content we viewed, were inadequate for HDR content.</p><p>Ultra HD HDR content shines in a realistic and rich way.</p><p> For the best Ultra HD HDR picture quality, we found that changing to movie mode instead of standard smoothed out the saturation a bit. For good measure we also turned off Dynamic Backlight, HDR Tone Mapping, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mpeg-file-2622031" >MPEG <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Noise Reduction. This helped the Ultra HD HDR content shine in a realistic and rich way.</p><p> Another image quality issue we encountered was<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macroblocking-and-pixelation-1847333" >video artifacts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which are glitches and distortions in picture quality. This can be a result of data loss due to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-media-file-compression-1847431" >media file compression <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , signal interference, or other factors. It was a particular problem when viewing HD Amazon Prime content, but we also observed it in Hulu content. Turning off Edge Enhancer and Motion Processing from the picture settings menu helped eliminate artifacting when streaming media, but it didn’t resolve this issue when we watched live TV via Hulu. There we got long sequences of pixelated content and macroblocking, where the image appeared broken up into blocky chunks.</p><p> We did switch the picture mode to Game when playing an HD game, but didn’t notice a significant difference in quality. The picture was already quite vibrant and clear without making this switch, and the only discernible difference was that Game mode made color tones a bit more saturated. Presumably the panel is deactivating some post-processing to improve input lag, but we didn’t notice a significant difference in either quality or latency.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KHIDIBlAKmxc6ZGa6AocjOoGEpY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_06-1fe0d195f3844b89822833f4c0f4d69e.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037334/7443" target="_top" id="2037334">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037334" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037334/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Well-rounded-and-clear"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Well-rounded-and-clear" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Well-rounded and clear"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Well-rounded and clear</strong></h2><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 is outfitted with two 10-watt speakers enhanced with DTS Studio Sound. According to DTS, this technology smooths transitions, volume, and bass levels while changing channels or sources.</p><p> Audio quality isn’t spectacular but is generally consistent and clear across media. The volume can get quite loud and fill the room, which is good if you don’t plan to add additional home-entertainment speakers. There are also bass, treble, and balancing settings that help cater to your individual EQ preferences.</p><p> Like the suite of picture settings, there are sound modes to achieve the most appropriate audio experience based on what media you’re consuming. These modes include Standard, Movie, Music, Clear Voice, and a user-defined Custom mode. Movie mode seemed to work out best for our preferences, yielding neither an extremely tinny nor bassy sound.</p><p> There are also the DTS TruSurround and TruVolume controls—TruSurround is on by default and functions to create a richer and more amplified sound, but TruVolume is off. Flipping it on helped control and even out fluctuations in sound, which was a problem we encountered streaming some content on Netflix and Hulu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FdoBEgX__hYz6EgBVAeh47z5pyg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_03-39faf55a89c8450cbddcb795f2f0fcc8.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043618/7443" target="_top" id="2043618">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043618" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043618/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Easy-to-use-but-cluttered"><a href="#Software-Easy-to-use-but-cluttered" class="headerlink" title="Software: Easy to use but cluttered"></a><strong>Software: Easy to use but cluttered</strong></h2><p> This Toshiba TV runs on Fire OS, which is easy to interact with but has some quirks. As an Amazon product it feature Amazon Prime content first and foremost, which may be convenient for Prime subscribers but is slightly less so if you’re primarily looking for Netflix or Hulu content. We found that the remote occasionally lagged if we didn’t point it directly toward the TV sensors, and virtually any time we loaded and exited apps or spun up Prime content. Loading time varied from a few seconds to upwards of ten. There’s also an odd bug when exiting out of the Hulu app. It routinely took about five seconds before the system got us back to the Home dashboard, before which it would take us to the Hulu home page.</p><p> The Fire OS Home menu is the spot that features recent apps, downloaded apps, as well as suggested content based on viewing activity. This arrangement is clear enough, but wading through options becomes more confusing based on the other menu pages, which include Movies, Live, TV Shows, Apps, and Your Videos. Much of the content you’ll see across these pages is duplicated, so overlap is a part of the user experience, which means clutter and confusion. Once you get a handle on this arrangement it’s easy enough to wade through, but a more streamlined layout would be welcome.</p><p> One way to avoid what can feel like a labored navigation experience is to use Alexa. But that doesn’t always make the process any easier. When testing commands like “Tune to ABC” in Hulu Live, we encountered a bunch of error messages. Searching the whole system for content through Alexa can make your life easier. Doing so brings up a menu of choices, displaying content availability on various streaming platforms as well as whether content is free or available for rent or purchase. Once you make a decision, Alexa takes you directly to the content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/grEHZxJFIUgX8TcaLouLrOiXNUk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_07-a8725babe7be46ad86619a83a5ca972a.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136614/26400" target="_top" id="2136614">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136614" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136614/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Price-Affordable-way-to-enjoy-4K-and-upgrade-your-streaming-experience"><a href="#Price-Affordable-way-to-enjoy-4K-and-upgrade-your-streaming-experience" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable way to enjoy 4K and upgrade your streaming experience"></a><strong>Price: Affordable way to enjoy 4K and upgrade your streaming experience</strong></h2><p> At around $450, the Toshiba Fire TV Edition is an attractive option for shoppers who want a smart 4K TV under $500. It’s considerably lighter than other smart TVs that skew more toward the $1,000 price range and offers solid sound and picture quality, plus instant access to myriad streaming apps and services.</p><p> If you’re thinking about cutting the cord with a streaming media player and purchasing a new TV, this Toshiba TV is a solid option that won’t require you to pay through the nose. It’s even more appealing if you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber and if you like the idea of a built-in voice assistant.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/798165/11305" target="_top" id="798165">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-798165" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/798165/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition-vs-TCL-55S405-55-inch-4K-Ultra-HD-Roku-Smart-LED-TV"><a href="#Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition-vs-TCL-55S405-55-inch-4K-Ultra-HD-Roku-Smart-LED-TV" class="headerlink" title="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch   Fire TV Edition vs. TCL 55S405 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Roku Smart LED TV"></a><strong>Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch</strong>   <strong>Fire TV Edition vs. TCL 55S405 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Roku Smart LED TV</strong></h2><p> If you’re looking for a happy medium between features&#x2F;functionality, saving space, and affordability, the TCL 50S425 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED Roku TV may be a worthy option. This smart 4K television retails for under $400 and blends 4K Ultra HD quality with HDR, resulting in vivid and exceptional picture quality for the price. The Roku TV is not only cheaper than the Toshiba Fire TV Edition, but it’s also 1 pound lighter despite being both slightly taller, wider, and deeper than the Toshiba 55LF711U20.</p><p> The other benefit of the Roku TV is the interface, which is more streamlined than the Fire OS dashboard. If you’re not overly enthusiastic about Alexa or Google Assistant, you could choose to integrate either down the line with the Roku—since it’s compatible with both—or forego them altogether. Alternatively, the Roku app also offers a handy mobile remote and voice control. If you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber you’ll still have easy access to that content through the Prime app, though it won’t be as prominent, which is actually a boon.</p><p> Consider some of our other picks for the best cheap TVs or the best TVs under $500.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A capable smart TV for active Amazon Prime users.</strong></p><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition is a big, bold, affordable 4K smart TV that’s ideal for Amazon Prime subscribers and Alexa users. It offers solid sound and picture quality, especially once you’ve chosen the configuration that work best for your viewing preferences.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tcl-50s425-50-inch-roku-tv-2019-review-4772224" >TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/insignia-ns-43df710na19-fire-tv-edition-review-4770716" >Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-xbr49x900f-49-inch-4k-ultra-hd-smart-led-tv-review-4796665" >Sony XBR49X900F 49-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126493/26400" target="_top" id="2126493">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126493" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126493/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition</li><li>Product Brand  Toshiba</li><li>MPN  55LF711U20</li><li>Price  $449.99</li><li>Weight  31.3 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  27.8 x 44.6 x 10.7 in.</li><li>Platform  Fire OS</li><li>Screen Size  49.5 inches</li><li>Screen Resolution  3840 x 2160 pixels (4K)</li><li>Ports:  HDMI x 3, USB, Ethernet, A&#x2F;C power, Headphone, Analog Audio, Digital Audio</li><li>Formats Supported  HD, 4K UHD, HDR</li><li>Speakers  Two 10-watt DTS Studio</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unlock-facebook-potential-with-effective-engagement-strategies/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unlock Facebook Potential with Effective Engagement Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-essential-tips-creating-striking-youtube-video-previews-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Tips Creating Striking YouTube Video Previews for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-tone-and-pitch-control-on-chrome-os-select-the-best-online-speech-converters/"><u>[New] In 2024, Tone and Pitch Control on Chrome OS Select the Best Online Speech Converters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/aggregating-the-top-5-mac-clipping-applications/"><u>Aggregating the Top 5 Mac Clipping Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/beyond-enhanced-graphics-exploring-the-full-potential-of-the-new-playstation-5/"><u>Beyond Enhanced Graphics: Exploring the Full Potential of the New PlayStation 5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-of-the-apple-iphone-se-2020-affordable-yet-powerful/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis of the Apple iPhone SE (2020): Affordable Yet Powerful</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-unboxing-the-samsung-gear-s3-frontier-a-versatile-and-well-equipped-smartwatch/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis: Unboxing the Samsung Gear S3 Frontier -

The ASUS BW-16D1X-U measures 2.48 x 6.50 x 9.57 inches, making it a bit of a desk hog, but with that extra size, you get serious performance for every task.</p><p> The ASUS BW-16D1X-U has fast access times on all types of optical media, so you’ll spend less time waiting around. It can access CD-ROM at 160ms, DVD-ROM at 170ms, and BD-ROM at 180ms. Its read and write performance is also stellar, with 40x, 16x, and 8x read speeds in CD, DVD, and Blu-ray, respectively. Likewise, it can burn CD-R at 40x, DVD-R at 16x, and BD-R at 16x.</p><p> So, whether you want to rip media from discs or burn data to them, the Asus BW-16D1X-U can do the job quickly. It also supports BDXL, allowing storage of up to 128GB on a single, compatible disc. Making the package even sweeter, the ASUS BW-16D1X-U supports Windows and Mac computers.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-bw-16d1x-u-blu-ray-drive-review-4774686" >Asus BW-16D1X-U Powerful Blu-ray Drive Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136613/26400" target="_top" id="2136613">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136613" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136613/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Budget-Buy"><a href="#Budget-Buy" class="headerlink" title="Budget Buy"></a>Budget Buy</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >LG GP65NB60 External Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Txzj4YX23tuIUnOsOlRGMfzEON8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/lg-electronics-8x-usb-20-super-multi-ultra-slim-portable-dvd-writer-drive---rw-external-drive-with-m-disc-support-black-gp65nb60-e74c64d858fc4e968d809333a31078d1.jpg" >LG Electronics 8X USB 2.0 Super Multi Ultra Slim Portable DVD Writer Drive +&#x2F;-RW External Drive with M-DISC Support (Black) GP65NB60 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >$25 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Reads and writes CDs and DVDs</li><li>Lightweight and very portable</li><li>You have color options</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Cheap build quality</li><li>Poorly designed eject function</li></ul><p> If you don’t need the Blu-ray capabilities offered by some of the more premium external optical drives, you can get a great deal on a CD&#x2F;DVD drive. LG’s GP65NB60 is a low-profile and affordable combo drive that offers both read and write capability for CD and DVD. Measuring 0.6 x 5.4 x 5.6 inches and weighing just 0.4 pounds, it even gives our top compact pick a run for its money.</p><p> The LG GP65NB60 can read CD-ROM at 24x speeds and DVD-ROM at 8x speeds, meaning it’s not lagging behind most of the competition despite its budget price. Write speeds are also decent, with up to 24x on CD-R and up to 8x on DVD-R.</p><p> The LG GP65NB60 needs a single USB connection for all its power and data transfer needs. Further rounding out the package, the LG GP65NB60 supports Windows and Mac, can burn archival-quality M-Disc, and comes in various colors, with black, gold, white, and silver on offer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043593/7443" target="_top" id="2043593">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043593" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043593/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Most-Compact"><a href="#Most-Compact" class="headerlink" title="Most Compact"></a>Most Compact</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >Verbatim External Slimline Blu-ray Writer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BO4kmGezMrCvhvw2CCVi4n592BU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/verbatim-external-cd-dvd-blu-ray-writer-usb-30-m-disc-ready---movie-playback-requires-playback-software-not-included-67c2a99c85c4425298b176462124e43b.jpg" >Verbatim External CD DVD Blu-ray Writer USB 3.0 M-Disc Ready - Movie playback requires playback software (not included) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >$126 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Solid metal case</li><li>M-Disc support</li><li>Comes with USB Type-C adapter</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Doesn’t include software</li><li>Isn’t cheap</li><li>Fragile tray</li></ul><p> Many modern laptops forgo an optical drive to trim their size and weight. But that reduction wouldn’t be valuable if you need an optical drive.</p><p> Measuring just 0.45 x 5.24 x 5.75 inches, the Verbatim 70102 is super compact. What’s more, the reduction in size doesn’t mean a bunch of compromises. It’s built with metal housing for a premium look and feel and is speedy.</p><p> It can write CDs at 24x, DVDs at 8x, and Blu-rays at 6x — even supporting M-Disc. It’s a CD&#x2F;DVD&#x2F;BD drive weighing less than half a pound. The Verbatim 70102 is a mobility champion, with power and data transfer over USB, so you’ll only need one cable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993652">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993652">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993652%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993652/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Budget-Alternative"><a href="#Budget-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Budget Alternative"></a>Budget Alternative</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >Dell DW316 External USB Slim DVD Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uXbXWSHrSmk0WgSQeogs9WgkNz0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/dell-usb-dvd-drive-dw316--black-5ec791f7068744c3bc87e2e91130a9c1.jpg" >dell-usb-dvd-drive-dw316–black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >$26 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/EXT-USB-SLIM-DVD-RW-OPTICAL-DRIVE-429-AAUX/44933803" >$34 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-usb-slim-dvd-rw-drive-plug-and-play-dw316-black/4697703.p?skuId=4697703" >$40 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Works immediately</li><li>Includes DVD burning software</li><li>Easy to move around</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>A bit pricey for what you get</li><li>Flimsy exterior</li></ul><p> The Dell DW316 measures 0.55 x 5.41 x 5.67 inches, making it both a budget and compact contender.

The drive also comes with six months of free cloud storage from ASUS, so you can rip content from your CDs and DVDs and move it there as needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557746/17382" target="_top" id="1557746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557746/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For"><a href="#What-to-Look-For" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For"></a>What to Look For</h2><p> For people who own and consume lots of media, an indispensable external optical drive is one of your best bets. External optical drives allow you to store massive amounts of data, including photos, videos, and software from CDs and DVDs, with easy access whenever and wherever you need it.</p><p> With hundreds of external optical drives on the market, finding the right one may take a lot of work. However, we’ve narrowed our top selections to the top four. We evaluated using five criteria: connectivity, compatibility, read&#x2F;write speeds, portability, and optional features such as low power consumption and M-Disc support.</p><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p><p> Our preferred external optical drive supports USB 3.0 or higher for faster data transfer speeds. It should also be compatible with Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android OS, and FireOS, which is preferable for users with multiple devices running different file types of all sizes.</p><p> Almost all external optical drives have a micro USB port, although the larger mini USB can save more files.</p><p> Other areas to consider with connectivity include BDXL support, which allows you to store all your files on a 128GB disc.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p> In addition to supporting standard CDs and DVDs, bolster your data processing power by choosing models with Blu-ray disc support. Ensure your preferred format is supported to avoid any returns due to compatibility issues.</p><p> If you store a lot of precious digital data, like family photos, you may want to explore external optical drives offering M-Disc support. These drives promise to last 1,000 years versus 7-10 years for standard DVDs before losing image quality.</p><p><strong>Read&#x2F;Write Speeds</strong></p><p> In short, the faster the read and write speeds, the quicker it will take to transfer large files or burn discs. Read speeds indicate how long it takes to open files, while write speeds indicate how long it takes to save data. At a minimum, look for read and write speeds of 40x (CDs), 16x (DVDs), and 16x (Blu-ray), although the higher, the better. No wonder why our Best Overall pick is the ASUS BW-16D1X-U Blu-ray Drive with read speeds of 8x (Blu-ray), 16x (DVD), and 40x (CD) versus write speeds of 16x (BD-R), 16x (DVD), and 40x (CD).</p><p><strong>Portability</strong></p><p> If you’re constantly on the go, we highly recommend a slim and lightweight design that is easy to carry around. One perfect example is the LG GP65NB60 External Drive, which is only 0.6 x 5.4 x 5.6 inches. It should be small enough to fit in a laptop bag, person, or backpack. Plus, many of them come with integrated cables, which keep your bags clutter-free and cord-free.</p><p><strong>Optional Features</strong></p><p> Other areas to consider when choosing an external optical drive are its durability and build quality. Check for ones with anti-scratch coatings, shock resistance, and sturdy construction to withstand wear and tear, especially when traveling, as they constantly get knocked in your luggage.</p><p> On the usability side, you may also enjoy external optical drives with silent operation and low power consumption, which offer a more comfortable working environment.</p><p> Kudos for any external optical drive with M-Disc support, as well as bundled backup software or free subscriptions to cloud services that offer even more robust backups.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-cd-players-and-changers-1846562" >The Best CD Players and CD Changers of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What are the advantages of an optical drive?<br> With media increasingly moving to digital rather than physical storage solutions, an optical drive may seem outdated. But there are still many reasons to invest in an optical drive, not the least of which is to access older media, a significant percentage of which still hasn’t been shifted to a digital&#x2F;online solution. This is especially true if you have games, videos, photos, or documents backed up on physical media. Optical drives can also be a handy way to create new backups quickly and inexpensively, and some programs require discs for emergency boot tools.</li><li>Can you read a DVD in a Blu-Ray drive?<br> Yes, both CDs and DVDs are compatible with Blu-Ray drives, and there are combo drives that can burn discs of all three types as well. By contrast, DVD drives cannot read Blu-Ray media.</li><li>How does an optical drive work?<br> Optical drives read and write data to discs using a laser. The laser creates pits in an organic dye layer on the disc’s surface to write, the reflected light from which can then be read by photodiodes in the drive and converted back into the original data. The disc spins, allowing the laser to read the tracks on its surface consecutively.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk is a powerful gaming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >desktop PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a surprisingly decent value to those that lack the time or ability to build a gaming desktop from scratch. I say this, reluctantly, as someone who has spent his entire life building gaming desktops by hand, not to mention countless video editing workstations for coworkers at the various places I’ve been employed. All this to say that I’m an advocate for building your own PC, but I still believe the OMEN is a pretty good value for a lot of people.</p><p> As configured, our HP OMEN Obelisk came equipped with Intel’s 9th gen i9-9900K and Nvidia’s GTX 2080 Super, a top-tier combination that makes light work of just about any game you might throw its way. All this comes at a cost for this tiny enclosure, however, and the components get very hot under load. The i9-9900k is an absolute furnace of a CPU to begin with, and the single 120mm AIO water cooler can only do so much.</p><p> How has HP reconciled all these things, and what does it mean for potential owners? Let’s take a look at the performance, build quality, and usability of this space-conscious gaming desktop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OXMiCXvzh8P7esVvbjPoSorzoxM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-2-7b14850c2ca84af39d5fd116ab483d5d.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148636/16836" target="_top" id="2148636">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148636" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148636/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Nice-looks-and-small-footprint-with-many-reservations"><a href="#Design-Nice-looks-and-small-footprint-with-many-reservations" class="headerlink" title="Design : Nice looks and small footprint, with many reservations"></a><strong>Design</strong> : <strong>Nice looks and small footprint, with many reservations</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk looks good in pictures but starts to fall apart a little when examined up close. Overall, HP did a pretty decent job here, but there are plenty of areas for improvement.</p><p> The first area of concern is the chassis itself. The shell of the OMEN case is constructed mainly out of plastic, which I’m sure helping a lot to keep shipping costs down, but definitely keeps the desktop from feeling like a solid, premium piece of hardware. It also makes me concerned about how durable it will be over time. Most buyers looking to spend this much on a gaming PC want to get some good mileage out of it, so this is somewhat disconcerting.</p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk looks good in pictures but starts to fall apart a little when examined up close.</p><p> The top&#x2F;front of the case features 2x USB 3.1 ports, a microphone and headphone port, and a power button. The USB ports are slightly misaligned on the model that I received making it a bit of a chore to plug anything in. I would love to have a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the front here since more and more peripherals are moving towards USB-C. An SD card reader would also have been nice for those out there that shoot video and photos, but I realize not everyone shares the same needs.</p><p> Upgraders and tinkerers will also find a mixed bag full of things to love and things to resent. The side of the case features a simple button release, so getting inside is extremely painless. If you are planning on adding more hard drives, HP has pre-wired two<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/serial-ata-sata-2626009" >SATA cables <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and SATA power connectors for you, and a plastic tray is present in the two drive bays for easy mounting.</p><p> Upgraders and tinkerers will also find a mixed bag full of things to love and things to resent.</p><p> Beyond adding more RAM or storage, you’re going to hit a wall pretty quickly. There are no mounts for additional fans to be installed anywhere, and there isn’t room in the case for many other CPU cooling options, should you be unhappy with the thermals. The pre-installed 120mm<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cooling-pads-4149823" >AIO water cooler <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is no match for the i9-9900k, where temperatures regularly crested 90°C during heavy workloads.</p><p> The OMEN gets plenty of things right as well. The plastic design might not be my favorite, but I absolutely adore the compact form factor. To put it in perspective, my already somewhat modest mid-tower case, the NZXT H440, measures 8.6 x 20.2 x 18.9 inches (HWD). The Omen, on the other hand, measures just 6.5 x 14.06 x 17.05 inches. Side by side, it’s plainly visible how much smaller the OMEN is, and for those with limited desk space, this will make a noticeable difference.</p><p> The lighting system is also approachable and understated, giving a little bit of customizable flare without going too over the top. As you’ll see later in the software section, HP has made it very straightforward to tweak any of these settings to your satisfaction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gfeGQoUwG35q5t-JwO07Ax4jm5I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-3-f4e655ec9e684a47855e9ee7373ba4b6.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134229/18498" target="_top" id="2134229">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134229" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134229/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Performance-Great-components-for-gaming-and-productivity"><a href="#Performance-Great-components-for-gaming-and-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Performance :Great components for gaming and productivity"></a><strong>Performance</strong> :<strong>Great components for gaming and productivity</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk that I tested featured a 9th Gen Intel Core i9 9900K, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and the Nvidia GTX GeForce 2080 Super graphics card. This is a potent combination of components in a gaming PC, and I was appropriately impressed by the results.</p><p> The desktop scored an impressive 6,967 in the productivity-focused benchmarking application PCMark 10. On the gaming front, the Omen managed a score of 10,740 in 3DMark’s Time Spy. In real-world use, this means more than 60fps at 4K in many popular titles like GTA V, but less than 60fps in others like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. In other words, the Omen is mostly capable of 4K gameplay and is nearly always capable of 60+ fps in most common resolutions shy of 4K.</p><p> The Omen comes equipped with a 1TB<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-m2-833453" >NVMe SSD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and 32GB of DDR4 2666 memory. This is definitely more RAM than games alone will call for, but it’s merely an adequate amount of RAM for some creative professionals working with more demanding software like Adobe After Effects. Keep in mind though, even those that don’t normally need a lot of RAM can still benefit from having more. Among other things, it gives you the luxury of keeping all of your browser tabs and background applications running without having to start juggling applications on and off, which can be helpful from a productivity standpoint.</p><h2 id="Gaming-Great-for-the-most-demanding-titles"><a href="#Gaming-Great-for-the-most-demanding-titles" class="headerlink" title="Gaming :Great for the most demanding titles"></a><strong>Gaming</strong> :<strong>Great for the most demanding titles</strong></h2><p> Gaming performance is great on the HP OMEN Obelisk thanks to the Nvidia GTX GeForce 2080 Super and Intel i9-9900K combo. I tested a number of games on my 3440x1440 monitor to get a sense of performance. To put this in perspective, this resolution is roughly 60 percent of the pixels of a 4K monitor.</p><p> First up was GTA V, which I tested with everything except for MSA (anti-aliasing) and the settings in the advanced tab turned up to Very High, the maximum setting. I recorded an average of 120.6fps across the 5 passes that the benchmark runs.</p><p> Emboldened by these results, I went back and turned every last thing up to its maximum setting, including everything in the advanced tab_and_ 8x MSA. I was quickly brought back down to earth, with an average result of 46.6fps. For one last pass, I nudged the MSA down to 4x, and came up with a healthy average of 66.8fps. Maybe dreams can come true after all.</p><p> Next, I wanted to try something fairly CPU intensive, so I ran the in-game benchmark for Civilization VI. I used the default settings for the Ultra preset, which netted me an average of 145.5fps. This was certainly an easy win for the OMEN Obelisk.</p><p> Lastly, I ran the notoriously resource-heavy Deus Ex: Mankind Divided using a few different profiles. On Ultra settings, the OMEN Obelisk saw just 55.7fps on average, with a minimum of 44.6fps and a maximum of 61.6fps. Dialing things down one level to Very High, things looked only slightly rosier: 58.1fps average, 49.5fps minimum, 62.2fps maximum. Finally, turning it down one more level to High found a sweet spot: 75.8fps average, 62.8fps minimum, 96.6 FPS maximum.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Pz9tV-mhJl_Cjm8HSqEQ_VZPbVE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-5-cdbd9d78a8c14b8e8bce0113d12e9fcc.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Network-Great-speeds-but-software-that-doesn’t-do-much"><a href="#Network-Great-speeds-but-software-that-doesn’t-do-much" class="headerlink" title="Network :Great speeds, but software that doesn’t do much"></a><strong>Network</strong> :<strong>Great speeds, but software that doesn’t do much</strong></h2><p> The HP Omen Obelisk has gigabit LAN and a Wi-Fi 5 (2x2) networking, the latter supporting a maximum speed of 866 Mbps. Everything functioned smoothly from a networking standpoint during my tests.</p><p> I made a point to try out the Network Booster software found in the OMEN Command Center and didn’t see anything tremendously useful, unfortunately. I tried setting the priority of Steam to “Low” and downloading a game, but the game still downloaded at my maximum internet speed. I took it one step further and toggled the “Block” option for Steam, and tried to resume the download, but Steam kept on downloading at the maximum speed. The software was successful in blocking Chrome when that option was switched on, however.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886003/19272" target="_top" id="1886003">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886003" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886003/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Just-enough-options"><a href="#Software-Just-enough-options" class="headerlink" title="Software: Just enough options"></a><strong>Software: Just enough options</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk comes with the OMEN Command Center, which is used to manage your desktop as well as any other OMEN products such as headsets, keyboards, and mice. From here, you have the option to click on your desktop and start managing your PC or choose from one of the various other options such as rewards, coaching, remote play, and My Games (a game launcher).</p><p> Select OMEN DESKTOP and you can access system vitals like GPU utilization, CPU utilization, memory utilization, and CPU&#x2F;GPU temperatures. This is also where you can access the lighting profiles, overclocking options, and a “network booster” that lets you prioritize application bandwidth usage.</p><p> The lighting is executed fairly well on the HP OMEN Obelisk. There are only two lighting zones: one for the interior of the case, and one for the logo on the front exterior. Through the OMEN Command Center, you can set and customize lighting profiles for each zone. You can choose a static color, but also may choose from animation profiles that cycle between preset or user-defined colors. Luckily you can also choose the brightness, if you want to tone down the lighting a bit, and choose a separate profile for when the desktop is asleep.</p><p> The option to overclock your system has you first run a nondescript benchmark, which produces a score with no reference point (to establish a baseline). While it’s nice to have the option, this really,<em>sincerely</em> isn’t a system you want to be overclocking. The i9-9900K CPU already runs alarmingly hot, even with its pre-installed water cooling solution. There also isn’t enough room for anything beyond a 120mm AIO watercooler, and not nearly enough clearance for a popular air heatsink like the Noctua NH-D15.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144272/7443" target="_top" id="2144272">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144272" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144272/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Highly-competitive"><a href="#Price-Highly-competitive" class="headerlink" title="Price: Highly competitive"></a><strong>Price: Highly competitive</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk with the same specs as this one can be found for around $2,000, at least when it’s in stock. Despite a lot of flaws that I can point to a nit-pick about, the price is one of the main reasons I still consider the OMEN to be a solid deal. I went through the trouble of parting out a similar build on PCPartPicker, going as far as to cut corners where I usually wouldn’t, and still arrived at just under $1800 before tax.</p><p> As far as I’m concerned, $200 is a perfectly reasonable premium to pay for a system that is already assembled and shipped to your door.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J3cZUfrEy-ALtFpRbDRhw7FZI8M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-4-f78d504d7bd348eca19b7e65b4d10289.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="HP-OMEN-Obelisk-vs-Corsair-One-Pro"><a href="#HP-OMEN-Obelisk-vs-Corsair-One-Pro" class="headerlink" title="HP OMEN Obelisk vs Corsair One Pro"></a><strong>HP OMEN Obelisk vs Corsair One Pro</strong></h2><p> If you want something even smaller, and even more monolithic, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/corsair-one-pro-review-5072820" >Corsair One Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Systems/CORSAIR-ONE/CORSAIR-ONE-PRO-i180-Compact-Workstation-Grade-PC/p/CS-9040001-NA" >Corsair <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) manages to pack a high-end gaming rig in a minuscule 12-liter case, making even the HP OMEN seem large by comparison. It has a very solid construction and manages to fit water cooling for both the CPU and GPU inside its small frame.</p><p> The Corsair One will of course be less customizable and harder to work in, and caps out at 32GB of RAM as opposed to the OMEN’s 64GB. The main differentiation however is the price—the Corsair One in a similar configuration to the OMEN will cost at least $900 more. Nonetheless, for those that really don’t plan to do any tweaking whatsoever, that value space above all else, might still consider the Corsair One.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>High performance and fantastic value, but upsetting thermals.</strong></p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk delivers fantastic value for gamers shopping for a high-performance, pre-built PC. HP has come a long way, and now offers a much more compelling solution that will appeal to a much broader set of buyers. That said, there is work to be done still, as the case suffers from poor airflow, poor thermals, and not a lot of meaningful ways to improve them.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Omen Obelisk</li><li>Product Brand  HP</li><li>SKU  B07WQ68VR8</li><li>Price  $1,999.00</li><li>Release Date  August 2019</li><li>Weight  29 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  20.4 x 19.4 x 11.8 in.</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i9-9900K</li><li>Cooling  120mm AIO liquid cooling</li><li>Graphics  Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super</li><li>Memory  32GB RAM (expandable to 64GB)</li><li>Storage  1TB M.2 NVMe</li><li>Ports  7x USB 3.0, 1 headphone, 1x USB-C, 1x HDMI, 3x Display Port, 1x USB-C (display)</li><li>Power Supply  750W</li><li>Network  Wi-Fi 5 (2x2), Gigabit Ethernet, Bluetooth 4.2</li><li>Warranty  1 year limited</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-goofy-flick-an-analysis-of-the-goofy-movie/"><u>[New] In 2024, Goofy Flick An Analysis of 'The Goofy Movie'</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-public-domain-calm-vibes-tracks/"><u>[New] Public Domain Calm Vibes Tracks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transform-your-web-exploration-with-microsofts-split-screen-functionality/"><u>2024 Approved Transform Your Web Exploration with Microsoft's Split Screen Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/boost-your-outdoor-internet-with-netgear-orbi-rb50y-analysis/"><u>Boost Your Outdoor Internet with Netgear Orbi RB50Y Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-screen-mirroring-oneplus-nord-ce-3-5g-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Screen Mirroring OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-principles-of-impactful-narrative-writing-for-films/"><u>In 2024, Principles of Impactful Narrative Writing for Films</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-best-spy-watches-for-your-motorola-moto-g-5g-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/minecraft-campfire-tales-skin-pack-review/"><u>Minecraft: Campfire Tales Skin Pack Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/momentmaster-framexd-review-visuals-excellent-expensive-costs/"><u>MomentMaster FrameXD Review: Visuals Excellent, Expensive Costs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/nba-2k19-review/"><u>NBA 2K19 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-get-noticed-10-amazing-animated-text-tools-for-social-media/"><u>New 2024 Approved Get Noticed 10 Amazing Animated Text Tools for Social Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/overcoming-gpu-glitches-without-freeze-outages/"><u>Overcoming GPU Glitches Without Freeze Outages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/r-type-final-2-game-crashes-effective-solutions-to-keep-your-gaming-smooth/"><u>R-Type Final 2 Game Crashes – Effective Solutions to Keep Your Gaming Smooth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/the-definitive-review-of-microsoft-surface-laptop-4-a-peak-performance-machine/"><u>The Definitive Review of Microsoft Surface Laptop 4: A Peak Performance Machine</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/ultimate-choices-navigating-the-top-consoles-dominating-2024/"><u>Ultimate Choices: Navigating the Top Consoles Dominating 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, the Insta360 One X2 is one of a new breed of cameras that aim to uphold this age-old truth by capturing absolutely everything around them in a single spherical image.

It’s compact enough to fit in a large pocket and feels quite rugged and durable, though those bulbous glass lens elements mean you’ll still want to be a little careful with it. Fortunately, it comes with a sleek neoprene case that offers a reassuring extra level of protection when you just want to carry the camera in your pocket.</p><p> The One X2 is fully waterproof down to 33 feet, which is a big improvement over its more sensitive predecessor.</p><p> Insta360 also includes a microfiber cloth, which is certainly useful, given the tendency for those lenses to attract smudges and dust. You also get a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> cable for charging, though a charging brick isn’t included.</p><p> The One X2 is fully waterproof down to 33 feet, which is a big improvement over its more sensitive predecessor. In order to accomplish this waterproofing, the battery compartment and USB port feature locking sealed doors. The locking mechanisms were a little tricky to open and close, but that’s a worthy trade-off for waterproofing. The battery doubles as the door to the battery compartment, and the microSD card slot is located within that compartment.</p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Controls consist of a shutter button, power button, and circular touchscreen.

This turned out to be a bit of a pain, with the Bluetooth connection used to activate the One X2 and set up the Wi-Fi connection repeatedly timing out and failing. Eventually, I got it up and running, and aside from the one hiccup, the process was fairly smooth, if more complex than I’d typically expect from a camera.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983446">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983446">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983446%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983446/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Good-light-a-necessity"><a href="#Image-Quality-Good-light-a-necessity" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Good light a necessity"></a>Image Quality: Good light a necessity</h2><p> My initial impressions of the Insta360 One X2 were tinted by the weather conditions in which I initially tested it. Here in Western Washington, winter can be gloomy and dark, so I ended up shooting in fairly dim conditions much of the time. As a result, I couldn’t help be shocked by how poor the video looked when I went to edit it. However, when given plenty of light to work with, the One X2 produced fairly decent-looking photos and video.</p><p> You really don’t have to worry about getting a stable shot even when walking or running on rough ground.</p><p> What’s really impressive is the degree of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/optical-and-digital-image-stabilization-488000" >image stabilization <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that’s possible in this camera. It’s good enough that you really don’t have to worry about getting a stable shot even when walking or running on rough ground. With this in mind, you have to consider the Insta360 from a perspective of the intended purpose. Action cameras have always been action-focused, and this is even more true of 360 action cameras. Basically, you need to do something interesting that justifies the trade-offs.</p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> One thing to remember about the One X2 is that its 5.7K recording resolution isn’t as sharp and detailed as you might expect, and when you crop down to a standard 16:9 frame you end up with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-the-term-1080p-means-1846837" >1080p <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . That’s good enough for viewing on a phone or small tablet, but the low resolution, as well as noise and image artifacts, become pretty significant when viewed on a large computer monitor.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938698/19272" target="_top" id="1938698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Unimpressive-overall"><a href="#Audio-Unimpressive-overall" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Unimpressive overall"></a>Audio: Unimpressive overall</h2><p> The audio recording on the One X2 could be charitably described as mediocre. It’s there, and it’s useable, but in a camera that would otherwise be well suited to vlogging, given its portable size and ease of use, it’s a little disappointing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030380/11832" target="_top" id="1030380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030380/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Storage-Requirements-Hefty-file-size"><a href="#Storage-Requirements-Hefty-file-size" class="headerlink" title="Storage Requirements: Hefty file size"></a>Storage Requirements: Hefty file size</h2><p> Though it may be the bare minimum for decent 360 footage, the 5.7L video footage the One X2 captures is still highly demanding in how much storage space it requires. A single short video clip easily takes up hundreds of megabytes of space, so you’ll want a big microSD card and plenty of hard drive space on your PC and&#x2F;or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Software-Brilliant-but-buggy"><a href="#Software-Brilliant-but-buggy" class="headerlink" title="Software: Brilliant but buggy"></a>Software: Brilliant but buggy</h2><p> Most of my problems with the One X2 have to do with the Insta360 app, and the big one is with the difficulty of connecting to the camera. Every time I connected to the One X2, I had to tap the connect button in the app over and over again until it finally connected.</p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Once it’s connected, the app is rather cleverly designed with a basic but well-conceived, remote viewing and control interface and a brilliant editing suite for processing 360 videos. From framing your shot and changing playback speed to creating camera movements using keyframes, it’s an effective and highly intuitive tool that allows you to quickly and easily process your videos on the go.</p><p> The software on the One X2 itself is quite basic, but considering the small size of its circular touchscreen, this is understandable.</p><p> The app also includes a fully functional social media platform where you can share your work and interact with other creators. Really, there’s a lot bundled into the Insta360 app, and fortunately, every aspect of the app includes extensive tutorials, though the text in some of these tutorials has not been translated into English.</p><p> The software on the One X2 itself is quite basic, but considering the small size of its circular touchscreen, this is understandable. However, as a result of the lack of accessible settings in the camera, I ended up frequently going back into the app on my phone to tweak things in the camera. This made the connection issues I experienced all the more annoying.</p><p> It’s also possible to take more control of your video editing on the computer via either Insta360’s free editing studio software or via a plugin in Adobe Premiere. However, it was easier to get the shots I wanted by editing them on my phone via the app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2002018/7443" target="_top" id="2002018">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2002018" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2002018/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Accessories-A-good-amount-of-options"><a href="#Accessories-A-good-amount-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: A good amount of options"></a>Accessories: A good amount of options</h2><p> A number of accessories are available for the Insta360 One X2. These include, among others, a diving enclosure and a “bullet time” attachment used to twirl the One X2 around your head. It’s also a good idea to have a selfie stick to use with the One X2, and I found a tripod handy for recording timelapse videos.</p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Price-Good-value"><a href="#Price-Good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good value"></a>Price: Good value</h2><p> With an MSRP of $430, the One X2 is only a little more expensive than a high-end action camera, but it’s not bad for a 360 camera.

Read on for our full take.</em></p><p> Nvidia’s RTX 30 series is the hottest thing in PC gaming right now. So hot, in fact, that it’s almost impossible to buy a desktop RTX 30 series graphics card, and even laptops with the hardware are flying off store shelves.</p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is, in many respects, a mid-range gaming laptop, but it succeeds at one very important task: it delivers Nvidia RTX 3060 Max-Q at a reasonable price, and it’s actually in stock not just at, but sometimes below, MSRP. Its value pricing helps the Triton 300 SE stand out against attractive competitors like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049388/7443" target="_top" id="2049388">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049388" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049388/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Small-but-sturdy"><a href="#Design-Small-but-sturdy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small but sturdy"></a>Design: Small but sturdy</h2><p> I’m surprised Acer didn’t slap a “Pro” label on the Predator Triton 300 SE. The spec sheet might scream gaming, but the laptop’s look and feel has more in common with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >business laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The aluminum exterior and simple silver interior keep this laptop subtle. It’s a bit dull, actually, compared to the sleek elegance of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-book-13-review-5176895" >Razer’s Book 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the brash look of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The Triton 300 SE measures 0.7 inches thick and weighs a hair less than 3.5 pounds. These figures aren’t unusual in 2021 but are impressive for a laptop packing serious gaming horsepower. It will easily fit in most backpacks or messenger bags, yet packs performance to rival modern game consoles.</p><p> It’s a sturdy little beast, too. The chassis feels slate-like in hand. Holding the laptop up by one corner reveals nearly no flex. The display is the weak point; opening the laptops can cause a few creaks and groans.</p><p> Physical connectivity is a mix of new and old. There are two USB-A 3.2 ports paired with a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port that supports DisplayPort Mode and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713" >Thunderbolt 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

It’s not especially bright and has a matte coating, so lacks the brilliant, eye-catching look that is common to high-end laptops with glossy, high-brightness displays.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop. I noticed this in every game I played.</p><p> Once I loaded a game, though, I liked what I saw. The screen’s resolution is 1080p, but that’s more than enough to provide a sharp, crisp look in modern games. It also supports a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-refresh-rate-2625984" >maximum refresh rate of 144Hz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , providing an ultra-smooth look in older titles capable of achieving a high framerate.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop. I noticed this in every game I played. Games with bright, high-color graphics look vivid, while those with a moody tone look dark and foreboding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eRv5Q4rKutM9zrhSTCRxbBO4rVc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-6-2af7f9999ae847bda4f5b9b830c9c555.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S.

I can’t give the Triton 300 SE too much flak for this given its otherwise excellent performance.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016165/19272" target="_top" id="2016165">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016165" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016165/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else"><a href="#Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else"></a>Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s most unusual feature is its Intel Core i7-11375H processor. It’s odd because it has just four cores (running eight threads) but is still sold as a top-tier component. The Core i7-11375H has higher minimum and maximum clock speeds than the comparable Intel Core i7-1165G7 found in thinner notebooks. The i7-11375H can clock as high as 5GHz. My review unit also had 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid-state hard drive.</p><p> PCMark 10 hit an overall score of 5,534. Geekbench 5 turned in a single-core score of 1,418 and a multi-core score of 4,493. The Geekbench 5 multi-core score is behind the curve;<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amd-vs-intel-which-processor-is-best-for-you-4780276" >new AMD Ryzen 7 5000-series laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can almost double that result. This will disappoint content creators who use CPU-dependent applications. The Acer Triton 300 SE won’t keep up with AMD-powered rivals, like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, in such workloads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_blPSVdy574t15clSGhbK6JH68o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-4-5a097b76e29b4ee985eee421ed6d0fe8.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> Gaming performance proved more impressive. 3DMark Fire Strike hit a score of 14,462, while Time Spy hit a score of 6,721. The laptop averaged 143 FPS in the GFXBench Car Chase test. It also averaged 74 frames per second in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at high detail with ray-traced shadows off.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ray-tracing-5097484" >Turning ray-traced shadows on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reduced the average to 56 frames per second.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution.</p><p> These numbers may seem disappointing if compared to all RTX 3060 laptops. You can expect more from Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 and the Razer Blade 15. But don’t forget the price. Acer’s laptop significantly undercuts those alternatives. When compared to all gaming laptops, this Acer delivers great performance for the price.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution. I wouldn’t recommend the Triton 300 SE if you plan to use an external 1440p or 4K monitor, however. Pushing a higher pixel count will lead to sub-60fps performance in most demanding games.</p><h2 id="Productivity-All-business"><a href="#Productivity-All-business" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: All business"></a>Productivity: All business</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s business-like design carries over to the keyboard and mouse. Key feel is good, with significant key travel and firm bottoming action, and the spacious layout will be comfortable for most users.</p><p> There is a flaw: some keys are smaller than they could be. The Control, Function, and Windows keys are noticeable examples. It’s an odd decision that can cause confusion when hunting for a keyboard shortcut.</p><p> Keyboard backlighting is standard and set to white by default, but the color can be customized across three zones. It’s not as impressive as the per-key RGB backlighting found on some gaming laptops but I’m happy to see some customization offered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IiMzYmVU-_I6PnObn0bkjyCzqUk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-3-7cae0e5d13154048bbc93c40976706ca.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> The touchpad is about four inches wide and two and a half inches deep. That’s not bad for a gaming laptop, but average for a productivity machine, and it can feel cramped. It’s responsive and rejects any quick, unintended brush by a palm or thumb. It’s smooth when using multi-touch gestures like two-finger scroll or pinch-to-zoom.</p><h2 id="Audio-Packing-a-punch"><a href="#Audio-Packing-a-punch" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Packing a punch"></a>Audio: Packing a punch</h2><p> This laptop packs a sonic punch. It has an upwards-facing speaker that provides clear, crisp sound in games, music, or podcasts. Maximum volume is loud enough to fill an office with music and overcome most ambient noise. There’s even a hint of bass that you’ll feel through your fingertips when the volume is cranked up.</p><p> This laptop packs a sonic punch. It has an upwards-facing speaker that provides clear, crisp sound in games, music, or podcasts.</p><p> There are limits, of course. It isn’t loud enough to project impressive volume in a living room or kitchen. It can also sound muddy and confused when playing bass-forward music or the most frantic action games. Still, it’s an impressive set of speakers that will rarely leave you wanting for more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918703/19272" target="_top" id="1918703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918703/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Killer-performance"><a href="#Network-Killer-performance" class="headerlink" title="Network: Killer performance"></a>Network: Killer performance</h2><p> Downloading a big, hot new game can be a real hassle, especially over Wi-Fi, but the Triton 300 SE can help. It has Intel’s Killer Wi-Fi 6 AX1650 and let me tell you: this thing rips.</p><p> It delivered network speeds of over 800 megabits per second (Mbps) near my router, which is typical. Every<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345#:~:text=Wi%2DFi%206%20is%20the,Fi%20faster%20and%20more%20reliable." >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> laptop I review manages that. I was impressed by its performance in my detached office, where the Triton 300 SE hit up to 195Mbps. By comparison, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-review-5179212" >Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> hit only 40Mbps in the same space.</p><p> This translated to excellent real-world results. I created a real-world stress test by downloading Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam while simultaneously downloading Metro Exodus on Epic. Surprisingly, both downloads averaged in excess of 25Mbps. I’m used to seeing numbers in the teens.</p><h2 id="Camera-BYOW-Bring-Your-Own-Webcam"><a href="#Camera-BYOW-Bring-Your-Own-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Camera: BYOW (Bring Your Own Webcam)"></a>Camera: BYOW (Bring Your Own Webcam)</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE straddles the line between entertainment and productivity in its design, but the camera falls short of its professional aspirations. It’s a tiny 720p pinhole camera that squeezes between the display and the top bezel. Video quality is grainy in all but the brightest rooms and uneven lighting can easily confuse it.</p><h2 id="Battery-Ouch"><a href="#Battery-Ouch" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Ouch"></a>Battery: Ouch</h2><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story. This is a powerful laptop yet, due to its size, it contains a modest 60 watt-hour battery. That would be fine in a laptop without discrete graphics, but this is a gaming laptop.</p><p> I didn’t expect much endurance and received even less. My first effort at using the Triton 300 SE for a workday of writing had me reaching for the power brick after 3 hours. Two further workdays put me at about 3 hours, 30 minutes each.</p><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story.</p><p> In fairness to Acer, there’s little it could do to fix this issue. A slim gaming laptop sucks down a lot of juice even outside of games, yet there’s not much room for a battery. The majority of gaming laptops I’ve tested in recent years have delivered less than 4 hours of real-world endurance, and the worst won’t last 2 hours.</p><p> Still, buyer beware. The Triton 300 SE might look like a productivity laptop, but its battery life is solidly in the realm of full-blown gaming machines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RSfl2dEVmErlvh3BUUFcxqsbt9w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-2-c5eed4bfe7e44014952b5503566097d9.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><h2 id="Software-Planet-what-now"><a href="#Software-Planet-what-now" class="headerlink" title="Software: Planet what now?"></a>Software: Planet what now?</h2><p> Acer ships the Predator Triton 300 SE with Windows 10 Home. It includes a few touches exclusive to Acer, including a Planet9 wallpaper and a few other icons under the same.</p><p> Despite this, most laptop functions are controlled through the PredatorSense software interface. It can control fan modes, adjust keyboard lighting, and monitor temperatures, among other functions. PredatorSense is not much to look at, but I find it less confusing than the alternatives from Asus and Razer.</p><p> The laptop comes with Norton antivirus installed. It’s eager to remind you of its presence whenever you download a file or visit an unfamiliar website. The antivirus is easy to uninstall, but its presence takes away from what otherwise feels like a special laptop in Acer’s Predator line.</p><h2 id="Price-An-outstanding-value"><a href="#Price-An-outstanding-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: An outstanding value"></a>Price: An outstanding value</h2><p> Acer sells the Predator Triton 300 SE for $1,400, and it sometimes sells for $1,350 at Best Buy. This is an outstanding price for a laptop packing Nvidia’s RTX 3060. There’s only a few competitors with the RTX 3060, such as MSI’s GF65 Thin, that can be purchased for less right now. The MSI GF65 manages to undercut the Triton 300 SE by using an older Intel chip and just 8GB of RAM.</p><h2 id="Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14"><a href="#Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14" class="headerlink" title="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14"></a>Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE and Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 seem to target the same users. They’re both compact, light 14-inch laptops that pack impressive CPU and GPU horsepower. Although great for gamers, they also appeal to content creators seeking an affordable, portable laptop.</p><p> The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 wins out in design and build quality. It’s an attractive, eye-catching laptop that feels more solid than the already respectable Triton 300 SE. The two laptops trade blows in display, keyboard, touchpad, and connectivity, with neither having a significant edge.</p><p> Game performance is similar, but the Asus G14 embraces AMD processors with up to eight cores. A well-equipped G14 will easily trounce the Acer in multi-core processor tests. Game performance is roughly similar when both are configured with an RTX 3060 graphics chip, with the Asus G14 having a slight edge.</p><p> While the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a better laptop overall, price is a factor. The Asus G14 is sold for $1,500 when configured with Nvidia’s RTX 3060 and is harder to find in stock. Paying a bit more for the Asus G14 makes sense to content creators who need its superior processor performance, but gamers could find more value in Acer’s alternative.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Excellent value for an RTX-powered gaming laptop.</strong></p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is an excellent value that has what gamers want: a great gaming experience and a quality display. Its short battery life and mediocre multi-core processor hold it back in everyday use, but the laptop’s competitive price makes these flaws easy to forgive.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-review-5069584" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-laptop-review-4795686" >Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-4779760" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997717/19272" target="_top" id="1997717">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997717" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997717/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Predator Triton 300 SE</li><li>Product Brand  Acer</li><li>MPN  PT314-51s-71UU</li><li>Price  $1,399.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2021</li><li>Weight  3.75 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.7 x 9 x 0.7 in.</li><li>Color  Silver</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>Platform  Windows 10</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i7-11375H</li><li>RAM  16GB</li><li>Storage  512GB</li><li>Camera  720p</li><li>Battery Capacity  60 watt-hour</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C 3.2 with DisplayPort mode and ThunderBolt 4, 2x USB-A 3.2, 1x HDMI 2.0, 1x 3.5mm audio jack</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-creative-constructs-top-6-minimalist-mini-mansions/"><u>[Updated] Creative Constructs Top 6 Minimalist Mini-Mansions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-historys-heaviest-battles-rts-review-of-7-epic-games/"><u>2024 Approved History's Heaviest Battles RTS Review of 7 Epic Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-outstanding.techidaily.com/mp4-to-wav/"><u>最新MP4 to WAVフリーソフトウェア: より良いオーディオ質に簡単パッケージ化のガイド</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/affordable-and-efficient-heat-dissipation-with-the-topmate-c302-pad-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Affordable & Efficient Heat Dissipation with the TopMate C302 Pad - A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/analyzing-the-lenovo-p11-pro-a-promising-tablet-with-room-for-improvement/"><u>Analyzing the Lenovo P11 Pro - A Promising Tablet With Room for Improvement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/analyzing-the-microsoft-surface-go-a-cost-effective-tablets-struggle-with-brand-positioning/"><u>Analyzing the Microsoft Surface Go - A Cost-Effective Tablet's Struggle with Brand Positioning</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/cut-editing-time-in-half-with-these-adobe-premiere-shortcuts-for-2024/"><u>Cut Editing Time in Half with These Adobe Premiere Shortcuts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/detailed-evaluations-of-processors-and-storage-solutions-at-toms-tech-space/"><u>Detailed Evaluations of Processors & Storage Solutions at Tom's Tech Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/easy-download-guide-thunderbolt-drivers-for-your-windows-computer/"><u>Easy Download Guide: Thunderbolt Drivers for Your Window's Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-can-you-transfer-files-from-itel-p40plus-to-iphone-151413-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How Can You Transfer Files From Itel P40+ To iPhone 15/14/13?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151871/7443" target="_top" id="2151871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925484/19272" target="_top" id="1925484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925484/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137395/7443" target="_top" id="2137395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137395/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134499/19576" target="_top" id="2134499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134499/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137209/26400" target="_top" id="2137209">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137209" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137209/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006941/19272" target="_top" id="2006941">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006941" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006941/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Hard-to-beat"><a href="#Competition-Hard-to-beat" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Hard to beat"></a><strong>Competition: Hard to beat</strong></h2><p> Nothing can really compete as far as power is concerned when it comes to the iPad Pro, so you’re mostly looking at compromises with certain benefits. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

Unfortunately, whilst the power is there, it is held back by its own operating system, forcing you into busywork or compromising missteps. It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868575/19272" target="_top" id="1868575">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868575" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868575/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-10-2-inch-7th-generation-review-4772313" >Apple iPad 10.2-inch (7th Generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-go-review-4690827" >Microsoft Surface Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-mini-2019-review-4688991" >Apple iPad Mini (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137394/7443" target="_top" id="2137394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  iPad Pro 11-Inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>Price  $799.99</li><li>Release Date  November 2018</li><li>Weight  1.03 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.02 x 9.74 x 0.23 in.</li><li>Color  Space Gray</li><li>Warranty  Applecare</li><li>RAM  4 GB</li><li>Camera  12 MP</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-asgardian-fury-final-conflict-era/"><u>[New] Asgardian Fury Final Conflict Era</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-techniques-for-realistic-photo-motions-in-illustrator/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Techniques for Realistic Photo Motions in Illustrator</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-iphone-vr-videos-unveiled-a-quick-how-to/"><u>[Updated] IPhone VR Videos Unveiled A Quick How-To</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/exploring-affordable-connectivity-a-comprehensive-tp-link-archer-c9-assessment/"><u>Exploring Affordable Connectivity: A Comprehensive TP-Link Archer C9 Assessment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/exploring-the-skagen-falster-2-sophisticated-competition-for-iphones/"><u>Exploring the Skagen Falster 2 -

Surviving Mars fills this planet-sized hole.</p><p> Released in 2018, the Surviving Mars developed by Haemimont Games and published by Paradox Interactive poses a massive challenge: colonizing a planet. When I picked this up, I decided to check out how the game fared for a two-year-old game in terms of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/graphic-design-basics-s2-1074288" >graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , gameplay, and competition. Read on for the verdict to see how it measures up against other games on our best city-building games list—and for forewarning about those pesky cold waves.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105860/7443" target="_top" id="2105860">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105860" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105860/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-Lots-of-options"><a href="#Plot-Lots-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Lots of options"></a><strong>Plot: Lots of options</strong></h2><p> For a city-building game, Surviving Mars offers a plethora of gaming options once you move past the tutorial. For example, when starting a game, you can choose who funds the colony, ranging from a United Space Federation to China to the United States. Each comes with its own perks and drawbacks, and creates new challenges for each scenario. You can also set more harsh conditions to create more fun<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/produce-videogame-videos-for-youtube-3562561" >gameplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as pick an area of land less suitable for human habitation.</p><p> As for a real plotline, there isn’t really one—the only kind of plot in the game is the objective to colonize Mars. There are challenges which you can do if you’re feeling particularly adventurous, which is nice, but they’re not a real plotline, and only serve to give you a different angle to colonizing the planet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tWjPu4rcPDZ30Ilhru3tUFnqjc8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_02-d1d5dfcccecb478098ab06a6b5137e68.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying"><a href="#Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Humans have never been so annoying"></a><strong>Performance: Humans have never been so annoying</strong></h2><p> The game begins with a multi-hour long tutorial program, which I highly recommend you undertake before playing the game. There are so many various aspects to the game—basic needs, threats to your colony, resources to import and export—that it would be disastrous not to get caught up to speed. It took me a total of five hours to complete these tutorials, but I had to restart a couple after a couple operator error moments when I accidentally destroyed my only water vaporizer and had no idea how to rebuild it. So, it will probably take you less.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony. You can build in a more stable area of the planet, at the cost of valuable resources like water and metals. Alternately, if you prefer to throw caution to the Mars winds, you can settle for a more resource-rich area. However, when I mention those Mars winds, I really mean it. In the midst of building your colony, you’ll have to beware the dangers of dust storms. Normally, I would brush these dangers aside in a video game. After experiencing them, however, they’re catastrophic, especially after you start adding humans into the mix. Besides dust storms, you’ll have to face off against cold waves and meteors, adding a fun layer to the game.</p><p> Once you get humans on the planet, it turns into a battle for your life. A cold wave can come around and knock out the entire water supply. A dust storm can malfunction all the machines that make oxygen. And a lack of resources aimed to relax humans—dining, shopping, and of course, that famous space bar—can send them teetering over the edge in terms of their mental health. It’s your job to ensure that not only are the humans on Mars healthy, but also happy.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony.</p><p> In over twenty hours of gameplay, I learned the hard way that humans in this game are not only picky, but they demand the life of luxury the second they step off the rocket and into the dome. It didn’t matter that only twelve called a single dome home. It didn’t matter that there was barely enough of them to cover operating the grocery store and space bar. A lack of space for these amenities fell upon deaf ears. They wanted access to their art stores, electronics, and fine dining immediately. In that regard, I’m a little conflicted; as much as I wanted more shopping options for Mars, I realized not long after humans arrived that Haemimont Games, in reality, gave me a blessing by keeping a bland palate. Plus, more buildings and items become available as research, funding, and planetary discoveries allow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QVd7bcTZ_ZbmQxeJCAcRbA8iomg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_04-e663486372a94a05afa9541d4d7930bb.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> The colonists also come with their own unique personality traits, from veganism to survivalist to alcoholic, so they all have their own service needs. You’ll have to factor this into your game as you build up your population. If someone doesn’t get their needs met, it can land them in the hospital, or worse, on a rocket back home. And don’t get me started on the chaos that erupts when humans start freezing during a cold spell or complain when they don’t have enough oxygen. The nerve of some colonists!</p><p> As my domes grew larger and the population started expanding, engineers would find themselves working in daycares and doctors would be working as security guards. They wouldn’t automatically shift over to open positions at facilities requiring colonists with these backgrounds.</p><p> Thus, the need for micromanagement began, and grew into a big thorn in my side during gameplay.</p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat.</p><p> I would have to manually go in and evict them from their homes and shift them to other domes where specialized positions would be. It became frustrating as I built up my population. I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><p> If it wasn’t the micromanagement, the gameplay foreshadowed the slowness of play speed in the beginning. Going into the game, I had no idea how slow it could be. The tutorial said that gameplay can be slow and encouraged the use of the speed buttons at the bottom of the screen. Admittedly, I’m impatient and like to speed up city-builders.</p><p> A good chunk of gameplay before the colonists arrived focused on speeding through slower parts of the game. Once the colonists arrived though, gameplay changed, and I found myself wishing for more hours during Sols, or days, on Mars. It’s a problem at the beginning; later on, not so much, especially when your population grows and you have to mitigate various issues that crop up. Many thanks to the creators for putting in Mars Radio and two other channel options with fun, futuristic music to help get me through until the humans arrive.</p><p> I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><h2 id="Price-Decent-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Decent-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Decent for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Decent for what you get</strong></h2><p> For around $30, you can add this game to your gaming library. It makes sense for a two-year-old game not to cost the regular price of new games these days. Even better, if you watch for sales, you can get it for cheaper. Be forewarned though—the other additions to the game, like the Laika Project, will cost you more. The $30 is solely for the base game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xyO7-tOzWWRT_ffxzC7TaIMOwH0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_03-9d30e99e7a0b4364bc86c4b40dfc99bf.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885947/19272" target="_top" id="1885947">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885947" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885947/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135355/19272" target="_top" id="2135355">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135355" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135355/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Other-city-building-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-city-building-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other city-building games"></a><strong>Competition: Other city-building games</strong></h2><p> What makes Surviving Mars unique is that technically it is a city-<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-offline-building-games-4580415" >building game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but instead of building bus lines, you have to build oxygen and water lines to ensure colony survival. However, just like city-building games, you are building infrastructure. If you’re solely focused on building up a city, Surviving Mars would be a great addition to your library, but so would<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities%5FSkylines/" >Cities: Skylines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on Steam). Both focus on creating a habitat from scratch—one just happens to be hundreds of thousands of miles away while the other could be in a tropical or a Midwestern climate.</p><p> If you like to worry about whether or not you are meeting commercial lot demand, or whether you will have to raise taxes to cover the construction of a new fire station, Cities: Skylines is a great option. But it focuses on the present on Earth, so some may feel it’s the same spin on games like the SimCity line that have been around for a while. While you’ll have to worry about budget balancing and fixing congested roadways in Cities: Skylines, you won’t have to worry about ensuring the survival of your people over a malfunctioning water vaporiser.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A interesting new take on city-builders, if you can stomach the micromanagement.</strong></p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat. It’s at a fair price point, promises lots of fun, and some fun twists and turns. Just watch out for those blasted dust storms. Your colonists’ lives depend on it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863035/11832" target="_top" id="863035">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863035" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/863035/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Surviving Mars</li><li>Product Brand  Paradox Interactive</li><li>Price  $29.99</li><li>Release Date  March 2018</li><li>Available Platforms  Windows, Mac, PS4, Xbox</li><li>Processor Minimum  4th Generation Intel i3 CPU or equivalent</li><li>Memory Minimum  4 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics  HD 4600&#x2F;Geforce 620&#x2F;Radeon 6450 or equivalent GPUs with 1 GB of video RAM</li><li>Game Updates  Green Planet, Project Laika, Space Race, Colony Design Set, Marsvision Song Contest</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-optimizing-video-conference-set-ups-slack-and-filmora-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Optimizing Video Conference Set-Ups Slack & Filmora Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-best-ios-psp-emulators-our-top-5-selections-for-2024/"><u>[New] Best iOS PSP Emulators Our Top 5 Selections for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-swift-video-transformation-with-top-8-apps/"><u>[New] In 2024, Swift Video Transformation with Top 8 Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-unbeatable-titles-the-creme-de-la-liste-of-10-vimeo-extractors-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unbeatable Titles The Crème De La Liste of 10 Vimeo Extractors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-insights-into-utilizing-photoshops-print-command-for-perfect-images/"><u>Comprehensive Insights Into Utilizing Photoshop's Print Command for Perfect Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/dos-and-donts-the-essential-night-photography-checklist-for-2024/"><u>Do's & Don'ts The Essential Night Photography Checklist for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/evaluating-the-reasonably-priced-sony-65-4k-uhd-tv-model-xbr65x850f-review/"><u>Evaluating the Reasonably Priced Sony 65 4K UHD TV Model: XBR65X850F Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/expert-review-maximizing-your-network-with-the-nighthawk-x6-mesh-wi-fi-system/"><u>Expert Review: Maximizing Your Network with the Nighthawk X6 Mesh Wi-Fi System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-show-wi-fi-password-on-infinix-smart-7-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Show Wi-Fi Password on Infinix Smart 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-life360-circle-everything-you-need-to-know-on-xiaomi-redmi-note-13-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Life360 Circle Everything You Need to Know On Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/mastering-multimedia-conversions-transform-video-and-audio-files-with-these-techniques/"><u>Mastering Multimedia Conversions: Transform Video & Audio Files with These Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/reviewing-the-cat-s42-rugged-smartphone-unmatched-protection-yet-moderate-speed-levels/"><u>Reviewing the CAT S42 Rugged Smartphone - Unmatched Protection Yet Moderate Speed Levels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/should-your-wallet-embrace-apple-tvs-price-tag/"><u>Should Your Wallet Embrace Apple TV's Price Tag?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/the-leading-choices-best-ergonomic-keyboards-on-the-market/"><u>The Leading Choices: Best Ergonomic Keyboards on the Market</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/the-remastered-odyssey-of-wasteland-2-directors-cut-an-expert-guide-to-a-gripping-turn-based-rpg-experience/"><u>The Remastered Odyssey of Wasteland 2 Director's Cut: An Expert Guide to a Gripping Turn-Based RPG Experience</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Though tracking data was never an issue, the software and companion app fell short of delivering a truly intuitive, user-friendly experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1166360/14483" target="_top" id="1166360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1166360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1166360/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Lightweight-and-a-little-too-familiar"><a href="#Design-Lightweight-and-a-little-too-familiar" class="headerlink" title="Design: Lightweight and a little too familiar"></a>Design: Lightweight and a little too familiar</h2><p> The Amazfit GTS is a super-light device at approximately 24.8 grams but isn’t flimsy. The body is made with aircraft-grade aluminum alloy, and the Corning 3 Gorilla glass covering the display is conveniently smudge-resistant. The back of the display is decidedly more plastic-looking, though the plate is covered in a matte finish with a pleasantly sturdy feel. The square watch face is slightly longer than it is wide, akin to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-se-review-5088223" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In fact, if you don’t look too closely, this device is almost an exact copy of this outsize name in the wearable game.</p><p> Along with the crisp and easy-to-read display, the GTS’s biggest asset is the flexible and durable silicone with a healthy selection of notches and two tabs to keep the band in place once you’ve latched it.</p><p> The always-on 348x 442<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/super-amoled-4151073" >AMOLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display is very vibrant and easy to read with 1.65 inches of real estate. The main screen is also highly customizable. Two watch faces (one analog and one digital) come preloaded on the device (and more are available through the app), and most of the widgets on each option are editable to show the information that you want to view most frequently at a quick glance.</p><p> Along with the crisp and easy-to-read display, the GTS’s biggest asset is the flexible and durable silicone with a healthy selection of notches and two tabs to keep the band in place once you’ve latched it. Though it comes in a single size, I was able to find a comfortably close fit on my small 5.5-inch wrist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hMe1Ur0Wtt9LDIiSfC3zvE_5G7E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazfit_GTS_Product_02-0b1e98c2de40486b9fea116eb28ccd3c.jpg"                      alt="Amazfit GTS"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><p> I was unable to test this device’s 50-meter water resistance for swimming or other aquatic workouts, but I did wear it in the shower without experiencing any issue. The manufacturer does note, however, that this wearable isn’t safe for hot showers or other water sports such as scuba diving, diving, and high-speed water sports, generally.</p><h2 id="Comfort-Easy-to-wear-but-not-as-user-friendly"><a href="#Comfort-Easy-to-wear-but-not-as-user-friendly" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Easy to wear but not as user-friendly"></a>Comfort: Easy to wear but not as user-friendly</h2><p> While the Amazfit GTS is stylish enough to wear all day and easily coordinate with your wardrobe and comfortable to sleep with, confusing interface issues impaired overall ease of use. Along with the modular watch faces, there are screens for nearly every data point measured, accessible by swiping up from the bottom of the device.</p><p> Unlike most trackers, the top two data points on this tracker are Status (which is really steps logged) and PAI (personal physiological activity indicator, a number that’s calculated based on heart rate and activity). These aren’t common metrics most users are familiar with, and the way these widgets appear on the watch and in the app aren’t customizable.</p><p> It’s stylish enough to wear all day and comfortable enough to sleep with.</p><p> Swiping down from the top reveals other popular functions for adjusting brightness, locking the device, or entering sleep mode, but these seemingly simple options didn’t always perform as expected—and required the use of the side button, which serves as a back and multipurpose button, to exit out of.</p><p> One standout example is putting this device in sleep mode. Unlike most wearables that deactivate the display with a tap of a sleep icon, the Amazfit GTS presents several do-not-disturb options that aren’t clearly explained by the onboard descriptions. This felt like a severe limitation to the out-of-the-box comfort of this device, which extends to other areas such as viewing sleep and fitness data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BCJ0gqS-gzR_dq3WSGazLqPMNCk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazfit_GTS_Product_05-9f844a14ab734d9291e338b6fa2519da.jpg"                      alt="Amazfit GTS"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><p> While the display looks great and is responsive, the lack of clarity about certain menu options, both the meaning and how to activate them, and the lack of control over data widget order, takes a few points away from the overall stylish look.</p><h2 id="Performance-Solid-GPS-and-decent-activity-tracking"><a href="#Performance-Solid-GPS-and-decent-activity-tracking" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Solid GPS and decent activity tracking"></a>Performance: Solid GPS and decent activity tracking</h2><p> The Amazfit GTS supports 12 common workout profiles, including running and walking, which I used the most. While it wasn’t spot-on compared with my usual tracking device, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-venu-review-4843916" >Garmin Venu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it wasn’t way off the mark. On one 3-mile run, the Amazfit GTS was less than 1 minute behind and the pace also followed suit at 9 seconds slower and 275 steps shorter, while heart rate was less accurate at about 15 beats faster than the Venu. Another pleasant consistency was the reliable onboard GPS and automatic stop&#x2F;start feature that worked fairly well, though with some delay.</p><p> The Amazfit GTS supports 12 common workout profiles, including running and walking, which I used the most.</p><p> The overall scope of data captured is relatively detailed and includes information runners appreciate like cadence and lap pace, but the app limits detailed or easy insights from the data since it doesn’t break down workout data by type and lumps everything together in weekly, monthly, or yearly views.</p><p> This device is also capable of tracking sleep data in a relatively extensive way, complete with sleep phases, times awake when you fell asleep and woke up. The watch never failed to track data and as far as I could tell, sleep and wake times were accurate, but reading the data was a little less straightforward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lrymbZEsmkXZy1YnjpGE5QutCbA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazfit_GTS_Product_04-109baf1e43444eff9789d9c02e2b2e77.jpg"                      alt="Amazfit GTS"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><p> While sleep data is elaborate, it’s presented in a way that requires a lot of scrolling or tapping back and forth across screens. For that reason, I never felt like I received a concise tip for bettering or understanding my sleep habits, which made the data feel a little too overwhelming and repetitive to make it approachable. This is an issue I had with referring to the app for any supplementary information.</p><h2 id="Software-More-style-than-substance"><a href="#Software-More-style-than-substance" class="headerlink" title="Software: More style than substance"></a>Software: More style than substance</h2><p> The best fitness trackers and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartwatches-4048042" >smartwatches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> also have intuitive companion apps, but that’s not a great strength of the Amazfit GTS. Like most<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/smart-watches-and-wearables-4781531" >wearables <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Zepp app (formerly Amazfit) is required to initially set up the device and view tracked data in more detail.</p><p> Too often in the app and on the device itself, there seems to be a disconnect between the user and the data and how to get the information you’re looking for.</p><p> While the setup process was uncomplicated in terms of getting the watch to a usable state, I never felt at home in the app even after a week or so. I suspect that no amount of time would really change my experience with the placement and presentation of data points.</p><p> Too often in the app and on the device itself, there seems to be a disconnect between the user and the data and how to get the information you’re looking for. While there are many fields related to body measurements within the app that could offer a fuller wellness picture, they all seemingly require the extra step of manual input.</p><p> And besides the slew of features that are greyed out if not applicable to the device, there is too much ambiguity about coverage for other fields such as VO2 max and training load, which the Amazfit doesn’t seem to measure comprehensively—but which the app doesn’t make clear.</p><p> Also, the arrangement of data and explanations about how this data is sourced can feel like a bit of a maze to maneuver. There’s an icon in the upper-right corner of the app home screen that leads to all data, which is broken down into categories that aren’t wildly intuitive, such as Status data and Health sign.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hqD81eq-Q8n6BPE_n48M4SpkIRA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazfit_GTS_Product_03-97749edaabac498bb95b0f8a9f569f0a.jpg"                      alt="Amazfit GTS"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896560/19272" target="_top" id="1896560">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896560" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896560/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><p> Certain data points such as PAI, like other areas of the Zepp app, are backed by scientific citations and explanations of importance, but there’s just too much text to make any of it digestible or glanceable.</p><p> While I gathered that a PAI of 100 seemed to be ideal for cardiovascular health, the app further complicated things by suggesting, for example, a 120-minute indoor workout to gain 15 PAI. It was difficult to grasp why that would be worth it or realistic, and like many areas of the software, it felt more flashy and underdeveloped than insightful.</p><h2 id="Battery-Solid-but-considerably-shy-of-the-14-day-claim"><a href="#Battery-Solid-but-considerably-shy-of-the-14-day-claim" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Solid but considerably shy of the 14-day claim"></a>Battery: Solid but considerably shy of the 14-day claim</h2><p> The manufacturer bills the battery longevity at an impressive 14 days with typical usage in smartwatch mode, which includes continuous heart rate and sleep monitoring and logging workouts three times a week.</p><p> That’s pretty much the way I used this device, though with maybe an extra workout or two and with the display in always-on mode, and the battery drained by day seven. On the bright side, it recharged quickly in less than the manufacturer’s 2-hour estimate. Amazfit also claims that the battery can last up to 46 days in basic mode without Bluetooth or heart-rate monitoring turned on.</p><h2 id="Price-Slightly-pricey-for-what-it-is"><a href="#Price-Slightly-pricey-for-what-it-is" class="headerlink" title="Price: Slightly pricey for what it is"></a>Price: Slightly pricey for what it is</h2><p> The Amazfit GTS retails for about $120, though it’s possible to purchase it closer to $100. While it’s more on the budget-friendly end of the spectrum, its Apple Watch-adjacent design doesn’t extend to the benefit of the first-rate fitness technology you’ll find in its alter ego.</p><p> Spending between $100 to $130 for a style-conscious, band-style fitness tracker from heavy hitters such as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-fitbit-4176010" >Fitbit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Garmin could increase the tracking benefits considerably with extras like VO2 Max and SPO2 monitoring. For a little more (or less), gaining a user-friendly layout and companion app could be worth losing the Apple Watch aesthetic this device works hard to mirror.</p><h2 id="Amazfit-GTS-vs-Garmin-vivosmart-4"><a href="#Amazfit-GTS-vs-Garmin-vivosmart-4" class="headerlink" title="Amazfit GTS vs. Garmin vivosmart 4"></a>Amazfit GTS vs. Garmin vivosmart 4</h2><p> While the Amazfit GTS sort of looks like an Apple Watch, it doesn’t really come close to performing like one. The Garmin vivosmart 4 is much more in line with what the GTS delivers. For $130, this band-style tracker offers a streamlined design with a few upscale touches like metal finishings and attractive band colors, but it also analyzes much more than the GTS does. It tracks stress, VO2 max, blood oxygen saturation, and measures what Garmin calls body battery, which keeps you attuned to energy levels throughout the day.</p><p> The vivosmart 4 is also safe for swimming and offers<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-android-1616887" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smartphone users the ability to respond directly to messages with canned replies, which the GTS lacks. Though the Amazfit GTS has a potential 2-week battery life in smart mode, the vivosmart 4 is good for a full week, which is on par with what I experienced from the GTS. And as a dedicated Garmin wearable user, I can attest to the generally more intuitive companion mobile app the vivosmart 4 and other models from this brand use over the Amazfit&#x2F;Zepp app.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A stylish fitness tracker with more potential than polish.</strong></p><p> The Amazfit GTS is comfortable and stylish and performs the basic fitness tracking tasks relatively well, but the confusing ecosystem diminishes the polish. If you love the look of the Apple Watch, this is a budget-friendly look-alike. But if you want a strong balance between performance and looks, the Amazfit GTS may not deliver.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997635/19272" target="_top" id="1997635">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997635" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997635/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-se-review-5088223" >Apple Watch SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-sense-review-5085832" >Fitbit Sense <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-vivomove-hr-review-4843913" >Garmin Vivomove HR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  GTS Smartwatch</li><li>Product Brand  Amazfit</li><li>UPC  851572007573</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2019</li><li>Weight  0.87 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.7 x 1.43 x 0.37 in.</li><li>Color  Desert Gold, Lava Grey, Obsidian Black, Rose Pink, Steel Blue, Vermillion Orange</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Compatibility  iOS 10.0 and above, Android 5.0 and above</li><li>Battery Capacity  Up to 14 days</li><li>Water Resistance  Up to 50 meters</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-definitive-guide-to-film-gear-buying-tips/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Definitive Guide to Film Gear Buying Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/n-2024-valorant-screenshots-transformed-by-rapid-skilled-designers/"><u>[New] In 2024, Valorant Screenshots Transformed by Rapid, Skilled Designers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-gps-drones-the-ultimate-follower-guide-compilation/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved GPS Drones The Ultimate Follower Guide Compilation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/5-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-trust-chatgpt-for-medical-advice/"><u>5 Reasons Why You Shouldn’t Trust ChatGPT for Medical Advice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-making.techidaily.com/access-the-most-recent-update-for-action-available-for-download/"><u>Access The Most Recent Update for 'Action!'
