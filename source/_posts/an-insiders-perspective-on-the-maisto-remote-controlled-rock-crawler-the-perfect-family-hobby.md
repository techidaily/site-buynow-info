## Ultimate Guide to Choosing the Perfect UPS : Our Expert Picks

 An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is a big battery that kicks in when the power goes out. We will focus on testing smaller desktop models that give you enough power for a desktop PC and leave the whole-house models to other experts.

 If you need a UPS, buy the[APC Back-UPS Pro 1500VA](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003Y24DEU/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4142625%7Cn5c900d52712540bf8e7c7a8a5e9a224616%7C) . It has a big enough battery to save your work and safely shut down without panicking.

 Pros

* LCD display
* Numerous outlets
* Small footprint
* Hot swappable batteries

 Cons

* No USB Port
* Large and in charge

 The APC Back-UPS Pro 1500 is a utilitarian device, but it has a little LCD screen showing vital information like input voltage, battery status, and the current load, which is a nice touch. While simulating a power outage by flipping a circuit breaker in the house, the UPS immediately kept our test computer running with plenty of time to save my work and shut it down.

 This device can also deliver over 800 watts of power, so you can safely charge any device at the speed you typically experience by plugging the same charger directly into a wall outlet. It's a bit expensive but a great battery backup for medium applications.

 While this APC model has ten outlets, only five are connected to the battery (the other five have surge protection, though). We feel five outlets should cover most setups adequately. This unit is vertically oriented, so while it doesn't have a large footprint, it will resemble a computer tower.

**Outlets:** 5 battery, 5 surge-protected |**Battery backup power:** 1500VA/865W |**Sine Wave:** Simulated

 Pros

* Lots of outlets
* Inexpensive

 Cons

* Documentation is sparse

 The Tripp Lite AVR750U is an affordable unit for very modest uses. Despite its smaller battery, the Tripp Lite will still give you enough time to save your work and shut down safely.

 Keep in mind: If you decide to go this route, the Trip Lite lays on the floor horizontally, so it takes up more space than you might be used to.

 Pros

* LCD panel
* Eco mode
* Twelve outlets

 Cons

* Short-term power

 This CyberPower EC850LCD is a UPS like the others on this list, but it has a trick up its sleeve. Three outlets (of the 12) shut down their output when the CyberPower unit detects the device thatâ€™s plugged in is in standby or[vampire mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standby%5Fpower) . That can end up saving you real money.

 So, the EC850LCD is a pretty modest unit, but it will allow you to save your work and safely shut down.

 Pros

* Widely spaced plugs
* Vertical orientation

 Cons

* Short runtime

 While a UPS can be useful for keeping a computer alive and working, for those of us working on laptops, keeping the internet up is just as important. The Cyperpower CP800AVR is designed for keeping your networking gear up and running.

 There are four plugs with battery backup and an additional four plugs with surge protection. The outlets are nicely spaced out so you can plug devices in with larger plugs (such as those that come with routers and modems). Automatic voltage regulation can fix minor power fluctuations without fully kicking in the battery power. That's better for your power consumption and overall battery health. You can stand the UPS up or lay it down, depending on what's best for you.

 Pros

* Tiltable LCD panel
* USB ports

 Cons

* Pricey

 The Cyberpower CP1500PFCLCD has a lot of what we like to see in a UPS. Its vertical orientation makes for a smaller footprint. The LCD screen tilts up to 22 degrees so it's more easily readable from the floor, and it displays a lot of information like wattage and remaining runtime. Speaking of runtime, at 1,000W, you'll get 83 minutes.

 There are 12 plugs on the back of the tower. Six of those are battery backup plugs and the other six have only surge protection. You'll also find a[USB-A](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-type-a-connector-2626032) and[USB-C](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490) plug for charging your mobile devices. It's a little on the expensive side, but we like this as a solid pickup for mid-sized computer systems.

* **I'm a gamer.** Nothing says "gamer" like a UPS with built-in RGB lighting and 900W power.

It also has ten total outlets: five with battery backup and five with only surge protection.

## What to Look For in an Uninterrupted Power Supply

### Compatibility

 When buying a UPS, the most important factor to consider is its compatibility with the power supply. Before hooking anything up, check what your devices require and make sure thereâ€™s a match.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### On-Battery Runtime

 Generally, you donâ€™t need a UPS to last too long but it should be sufficient to start a standby power source or properly shut down the protected equipment. Some run for just a few minutes, while others will provide power all night long. Depending on your needs, make sure the on-battery runtime is ample.

### Device Support

 How many devices will you need to connect to your UPS? Some can accommodate as many as 12 devices, while others top out at just two. Some also provide USB ports, but not all.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Portability

 Some UPS devices are made for home or business use, while others are built for travel and the outdoors. If you need to take your device with you, youâ€™ll want something with a more portable design that can fit in a handbag easily. You might even want a solar charging port so that you arenâ€™t entirely dependent on electricity.

[How to Get the Right Surge Protector for Electronics](https://www.lifewire.com/best-surge-protectors-3276141)

 FAQ

* How big of a UPS do you need?  
 This answer depends on what devices your UPS will support and for how long. If you're hooking up a couple of desktop computers or a home entertainment system, you can get away with a 750 VA battery backup. It gives you ample time to save your work and shut down your devices properly without incident. However, you'll need something larger for commercial setups like server farms. Something closer to a 2200 VA backup can provide ample insurance to even the most power-hungry tech.
* Can you replace the battery on your UPS and how long will it last?  
 Not all UPS have replaceable or "hot-swappable" batteries. But unless you need to have your UPS remain on battery power for an extended period, having "hot-swappable" batteries isn't entirely necessary, and the lifespan for a typical battery can be anywhere from 3 to 5 years, meaning you shouldn't have to replace your battery very often.
* What will benefit the most from a UPS?  
 Any appliance can benefit from being connected to a UPS, but items that one should tether to a UPS are sensitive electronics like TVs, home theater receivers, or computer desktops. While a UPS can effectively act as a power strip for any appliance, prioritizing anything that could get damaged by abruptly losing power will let you get the most out of your UPS. Some other use cases for a UPS include electronics that should not lose power for any reason, like fish tanks and home security systems.
* What's the difference between pure sine wave or stepped sine wave battery?  
 Anything you plug into the wall with a plug runs on alternating current or AC. For a battery to power a device designed for alternating current, it must provide power in a sine wave. A pure sine wave, which has a much cleaner output, is suitable for sensitive electronics like newer TVs, servers, computers, audio equipment, and appliances that use an AC motor, like refrigerators or microwaves. Older TVs, water pumps, and motors with brushes can use modified sine wave output because they're not as sensitive. Devices will run hotter and less efficiently with modified or stepped sine wave output.
