##  What to Consider When Buying Smart Glasses in 2024

 Smart glasses are an excellent tech choice for hands-free communication, more convenient ways to snap photos, on-the-go voice-command audio, or everyday eyewear with smart capabilities. They come in different forms, and a pair of augmented reality (AR) smart glasses can even give you a vast and virtual private screen to enjoy blockbusters, shows, and games.

 When buying smart glasses, there are several key factors to consider. Display resolution is your first consideration. Full HD (1920x1080) is the norm for decent-quality smart glasses, and if they [have this resolution](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-4-ways-to-trace-oppo-reno-11f-5g-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), they should provide sharp details and good contrast.

 However, it’s not the only thing to consider if you want a good display. To get a less “window-like” experience, consider the field of view (FOV). Look for around 50 degrees to get that immersive experience. Premium models may even offer wider FOVs, while virtual reality headsets typically offer a horizontal FOV between 100 and 120 degrees.

[Peak brightness](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-covert-videography-the-premier-8-downloader-list/) is also a key consideration for a quality display. Aim for around 1,000 nits if you want outdoor visibility on days when sunlight is strong. And if you like vibrant colors and deep, inky blacks, you’ll be best served by a pair featuring OLED or micro-LED displays.

 While audio quality has improved in smart glasses in recent times, they still lack deep low frequencies to get the most out of music, especially if you enjoy more bass-centric genres, such as hip-hop. The speakers are generally open-ear and can’t offer things like active noise cancelation (ANC). However, some models have improved their mid and high frequencies and can be good choices for making calls and listening to podcasts. However, earbuds are still recommended for the best music experience.

 You should check the resolution if you seek a pair with a camera. Look for at least a 12MP camera resolution and 1080p at 30FPS video at a minimum. But when you continually snap photos, the battery will drain. So, battery life is another crucial factor to look for. Expect at least four hours of usage from a good pair, and check how many full charges any charging case they come with can provide.

 Lastly, you will likely want to look good and feel comfortable if you wear your chosen glasses outside. Seek a stylish design as well as a lightweight and ergonomic build. For extended, comfortable wear, your glasses for everyday eyewear should be under 2.8oz (80 grams). This also applies to augmented reality glasses you may purchase for entertainment purposes. Additionally, if you need corrective lenses, check whether the smart glasses can accommodate prescription inserts or offer custom-made ones.

 The [XREAL Air 2](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CH11V8B9?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003983&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-smart-glasses%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) augmented reality glasses succeed the originals and deliver some nice upgrades. For anyone looking for huge-screen entertainment at home or when traveling, the large, up to 330-inch virtual screen is ideal for movies, TV shows, and gaming.

 These lightweight frames (in fact, XREAL claims they are the world’s lightest AR glasses) are also very comfortable. They feature a 50:50 weight distribution for easy all-day wear and four-size Air Cushion nose pad brackets for a snug fit.

 With the latest micro-OLED panels from Sony, the XREAL Air 2 glasses deliver a Full HD resolution to each eye with a 46-degree field of view. The picture is TÜV certified for color accuracy and is detailed and sharp. With 500 nits of [peak brightness](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-covert-videography-the-premier-8-downloader-list/), they’re 25 percent more luminous than their predecessors. However, despite XREAL’s claims of “cinematic sound” with [spatial audio](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-pattern-locks-are-unsafe-secure-your-samsung-galaxy-a14-5g-phone-now-with-these-tips-by-drfone-android/), the bass is still a problem for glasses of this type, and [sound leakage](https://win-forum.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-methods-for-fixing-application-failure-on-pc-messages/) can still occur at high volumes.

 Gamers, especially those using handheld devices, will have a blast on the XREAL Air 2's vast screen. But while it does boast a [120Hz refresh rate](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-quick-guide-sharing-igtv-in-the-world-of-insta-stories/), not all devices support this, and there can still be the occasional lag and frame-rate issue when playing fast-paced games.

 There’s also the "optional" accessory of the Beam, a wireless adapter that enhances connectivity and functionality. It can feel more like a necessity, especially for gamers, when you consider you need it to connect to certain consoles, including the Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.

 However, investing in the [Beam accessory](https://www.amazon.com/Spatial-Portable-Compatible-Playstation-SteamDeck-nintendo/dp/B0CC94Z9LX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003983&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-smart-glasses%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) also extends the battery life by three hours. It enables features like Body Anchor mode, which keeps the virtual screen in a fixed position relative to your body movement. You can save a little by opting for the [XREAL Air 2 and Beam bundle](https://www.amazon.com/XREAL-Wearable-Streaming-Projector-Alternative/dp/B0CNLTVGWD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003983&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-smart-glasses%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 The [Razer Anzu Smart Glasses](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Anzu-Smart-Glasses-Built/dp/B08ZC9Y33Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003983&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-smart-glasses%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) have recently fallen in price considerably, and they are now considered a good budget choice for anyone seeking an affordable set of smart glasses. While their audio quality is far from groundbreaking, the glasses’ strengths lie in communication and connectivity rather than media consumption.

 With an excellent microphone, the Razer Anzu glasses are ideal for participating in conference calls and Zoom meetings. They’re more comfortable than wearing a headset or earbuds and look like regular stylish glasses. They’re also a good choice for taking phone calls, and you can receive notifications and alerts without the inconvenience of getting your smartphone out.

 And while you might consider the audio quality below average—though weak bass is something that most smart glasses suffer from—listening to podcasts or music in quieter environments is fine. The lack of [sound isolation](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/accessing-google-meet-via-device/) is also less of an issue here, but external noise disrupts your listening experience in noisy situations.

 The frames come with two sets of lenses; one is a [blue light-filtering](https://win-able.techidaily.com/outriders-performance-boost-eliminate-lag-issues-with-these-proven-tips/) set, and the other is a pair of polarized sunglasses that are easy to swap out. Razer has also partnered with Lensabl to offer replacement prescription lenses.

 The glasses are comfortable to wear all day, and the stylish design means you can use them even when not making calls or listening to audio. They feature glossy plastic frames with thick temples that house the electronics and are available in small and large sizes with your choice of rectangular or round lenses.

 The [Viture Pro XR Glasses](https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-Glasses-UltraClarity-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003983&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-smart-glasses%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) deliver a vast, bright display of stunning visuals for immersive, big-screen gameplay. Advanced anti-glare and [anti-ghosting](https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elevate-your-video-presentation-with-these-7-free-makers/) technology ensures a sharp, clear picture, while users with nearsightedness can fine-tune the focus using the glasses’ myopia adjustment feature. They are lightweight at just 2.8oz (78g) and feature adjustable nose pads to help you find the right size for your face.

 The Viture Pro XR Glasses function more like advanced AR (augmented reality) glasses. They project a large virtual screen with enhanced display features and emulate a sizeable 135-inch screen viewed from 9.8 feet away. Visuals are sharp and vibrant with excellent dynamic range thanks to the Sony micro-OLED panel and Full HD resolution. Additionally, the 120Hz refresh rate delivers more fluid gameplay, provided your device supports that frame rate.

 And, despite Viture’s claim of a peak brightness of up to 4,000 nits, the perceived brightness is closer to 1,000 nits, which is still impressively bright. It allows for good visibility in most conditions, including outdoor environments where strong sunlight might be an issue. Moreover, the glasses feature integrated electrochromic film technology that enables you to block nearly all external light with a simple button press when needed.

 The Harmon Kardon-engineered speakers deliver good audio when listening in a quiet environment. However, like most smart glasses of this type, it’s best to use earbuds if you want overall audio-visual immersion. Background noise is a problem even when you have the volume maxxed out but they do an excellent job of containing sound leakage.

 The [Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses](https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Ray-Ban-Wayfarer-Standard-Glasses/dp/B0CGXYM9TP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003983&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-smart-glasses%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) replace the Ray-Ban Stories make multiple strides in terms of development. While they’re still far from perfect, the audio has improved, as has the camera quality. Partnering up with Ray-Ban has yet again proved to be a stroke of genius for Meta, as these glasses are also slimmer and even more stylish.

 In addition, there’s an added [IPX4 rating](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-artificer-intelligence-redefines-what-we-perceive-as-real-or-just-a-story/) for protection from light rain and splashes, and the charging case is more lightweight. The glasses also feature integrated [Meta AI](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-getting-the-most-out-of-live-sports-on-youtube-tv/), which is generally reliable in acquiring information but can be slow and still has some way to go before fulfilling its true potential.

 The sleek, stylish design makes them an excellent buy for use as everyday eyewear with added smart capabilities. You can create your own custom frame and lens combinations from the Headliner, Skyler, and Wayfarer designs, and they are available in large or regular sizes, with the Headliner style offering a low-bridge fit.

 The lenses are available in several colors, or you can choose blue-light filtering, polarized, or Transition lenses, with the latter changing from light to dark depending on how bright it is. They are also prescription lens compatible, or you can get your vision needs addressed and fitted at [LensCrafters stores](https://www.lenscrafters.com/lc-us/ray-ban-meta?page=1).

 The 12MP camera offers a significant upgrade to the previous 5MP that the Ray-Ban Stories featured and is seamlessly integrated into the lightweight frames. Image quality is getting closer to what smartphones can offer, although dynamic range and detail still fall short, and you need to be in good light to get the best shots.

 Video quality is decent, as well. You can record hands-free in Full HD, while the five-mic system does a good job during calls, although it still picks up background noise and wind. Thanks to improved mids and highs in the speakers, you can hear who you are talking to loud and clear. This also ensures listening to podcasts while on the go is a pleasure. However, the bass is still lacking, so for a better music experience, you may still feel inclined to use a pair of [quality earbuds](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/locked-out-of-apple-iphone-xs-max-5-ways-to-get-into-a-locked-apple-iphone-xs-max-by-drfone-ios/).

 In terms of how long you can use the glasses, you’ll get around four hours from the built-in battery, and the charging case provides a further 32 hours (eight full charges) for an approximate total of 36 hours.

### What can smart glasses do?

 Smart glasses can do a range of things. However, what they specifically do depends on the type of glasses you buy. Some smart glasses have integrated cameras to take photos and videos, and some even allow you to livestream. Others offer stylish everyday eyewear with smart functionality for convenience and productivity and provide audio listening and calls. A good example of this is the [Amazon Echo Frames (3rd Gen)](https://amazon.com/dp/B09SVDWTYC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003983&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-smart-glasses%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which also integrates Alexa for smart home control.

 Augmented reality (AR) glasses, on the other hand, overlay digital information onto the real world but are mostly at the stage where they are best suited for displaying augmented virtual screens for entertainment purposes.

 And, while not exactly glasses, you can use virtual reality (VR) headsets for immersive gaming and other scenarios, such as simulations or virtual tours. [Playstation VR2](https://amazon.com/dp/B0C1QJ6VHY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003983&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-smart-glasses%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), for example, can take your PS5 games to extraordinary new levels. Mixed reality (MR) glasses, on the other hand, such as [Meta Quest 3](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CD1JTBSC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003983&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-smart-glasses%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), combine AR and VR and allow digital and physical objects to interact. They can also be used in gaming environments, while they can revolutionize your productivity, too. 

### Can you watch movies on smart glasses?

 Yes, you can watch movies on your smart glasses. But it depends on the style of glasses you have. AR glasses are the best choice if your purpose is solely entertainment. They display a vast virtual screen for you to enjoy blockbusters, TV shows, and video games. On a good pair, the virtual screens are immersive, with sharp details and excellent color accuracy. However, audio still hasn’t reached the level required to really enjoy an immersive audiovisual experience. Therefore, in most cases, the recommendation is still to make use of a good pair of earbuds.

 VR and MR glasses are more like headsets. They are heavier than AR glasses and can get uncomfortable and hot after extended use. But they do offer a more immersive movie experience with high-quality audio.

### Can you take pictures with smart glasses?

 If your glasses have a camera, you can take pictures. However, you should note that image quality still doesn't yet match that of a decent smartphone and is certainly somewhat away from competing with [DSLRs](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-watch-hulu-outside-us-on-vivo-y78-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) and [mirrorless](https://os-tips.techidaily.com/restoring-lost-information-from-your-iphone-expert-guide-and-tips/) cameras.

 Most of the time, you can directly share your photos to your socials with simple voice commands but you should respect people’s privacy when using your camera. Always seek consent before snapping shots of others, especially in public places. And, if your glasses have an indicator light that signals when you are operating the camera, make sure it is visible and unobstructed.
