##  What to Look for in a Smart Space Heater in 2024

 Homes are getting smarter by the day. Now, we can [lock doors remotely](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-periscope-recording-for-beginners-a-complete-walkthrough/), view real-time feeds of [security cameras](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-enhance-your-game-experience-with-these-5-screen-capture-techniques-for-minecraft-mac/), and even clean up after our pets via a [robot mop](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-filmmakers-choice-selecting-perfect-lenses-for-youtube-creation/). While some [smart home devices](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-masterpiece-in-motion-capture-sonys-x1000-action-gear/) seem gimmicky, having the ability to control a room's heating is something that most households can use.

 But we're not talking about [smart thermostats](https://win-forum.techidaily.com/top-four-social-networking-sites-facebook-twitter-instagram-and-youtube/)—we're talking about smart space heaters that are conveniently sized to add the right amount of heat to a room when you need it.

 Wi-Fi space heaters connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can control them via a compatible app on your smartphone. Some even offer voice assistant compatibility to heat a room using simple voice commands. Some of the best smart space heaters will even notify you when the desired heat has been reached so you can switch it off and save electricity.

 Smart space heaters are designed to heat spaces without taking up much physical space. With all our devices in our daily lives, the last thing you want is a chunky electric heater taking up space.

 So, consider the room you have, the features you want, and how much you want to be able to control your smart space heater, then dive into our recommendations below.

_Dyson_

| Pros                         | Cons        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| ✓ Voice Assistant compatible | ✗ Expensive |
| ✓ Multifunctional            |             |
| ✓ App controlled             |             |
| ✓ Runs quiet                 |             |
| ✓ HEPA Filtration            |             |

 With its smart 3-in-1 HEPA air filtration, heater, and fan functionality, the Dyson Purifier Hot + Cool HP07 supplies the ultimate in-home comfort, all year round. This multifunctional smart space heater intelligently purifies, heats, and cools you on demand. It really is an all-in-one package.

 Using the [MyDyson](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU201951/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dyson.mobile.android&hl=en&gl=US) companion app, you can monitor your air quality and control the HP07 remotely, setting timers or schedules to suit your lifestyle. Plus, compatibility with Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant means you can also enjoy hands-free voice control. 

 Its Air Multiplier technology draws in pollutants and projects out purified hot or cool air throughout the room, thanks to its long-range projection. Oscillating up to 350 degrees, it provides excellent coverage for any size space up to 290 square feet. 

 Providing a superior heating experience is great, but the real beauty of the Dyson HP07 is that you benefit from cleaner, purer air. Drawing and trapping 99.97% of unwanted airborne particles, it doesn't simply blow around stale, unclean air as it warms you. By cleaning the air as it heats it, you can enjoy a dust-free air supply as you snuggle up and get cozy. 

 The only sticking point here is the price tag, which is considerable. But with its triple functionality, and your choice of remote, app, or voice controls, this smart space heater is highly intuitive and efficient to use. And with the promise of cleaner and purer air throughout every season, you might find yourself warming up to this impressive smart space heater.

 The [Govee Space Heater](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Electric-Thermostat-Bluetooth-Assistant/dp/B09WZZ3FN7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201951&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F888477%2Fbest-smart-space-heaters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a budget-friendly smart space heater with all the bells and whistles but a smaller price tag. It works with Google Assistant, Alexa, and offers seamless controls via the [Govee Home app](https://www.govee.com/govee-home). This space heater is also suitable for most average-sized rooms, maintaining temperatures between 68-77 degrees Fahrenheit within a 160-270 square foot area.

 Once turned on, the Govee Space Heater warms up in seconds, pushing hot air into the space and covering the whole room when oscillating. To ramp up things, you can choose between low, medium, and high fan settings, but be warned that things can get noisy at the highest setting.

 For safety purposes, the Govee Space Heater features a tip-over switch and over-heating protection. Although the base can feel a little less sturdy on carpet compared to a hard floor, the reassurance is there from the safety features, especially if you have children around.

 With a built-in thermostat, this smart space heater can turn on and off the heat when required. The thermostat monitors the room's temperature and turns off when the set temperature is reached. Similarly, if the set temperature drops by more than four degrees, the Govee Space Heater will kick back into action. Moreover, you can pair the heater with the [Govee Thermo-Hygrometer](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Hygrometer-Thermometer-Notification-Connecting/dp/B097HF322L?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201951&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F888477%2Fbest-smart-space-heaters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to reach even more areas of a larger room.

 Using the Govee Home app is simple and effective. You can set on/off timers, heat levels, fan speeds, oscillation, and even lock the device so no other members of your household can change the settings. Although a remote control is not included, you can use Google Assistant, Alexa, and IFTTT to issue voice commands.

| ✓ Small enough to place on a desk |                                      |

 Thanks to its size and wide-angle oscillation, the [Atomi Smart Heater](https://www.amazon.com/Atomi-Smart-Portable-Tabletop-Heater/dp/B08B1W7ZY7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201951&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F888477%2Fbest-smart-space-heaters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) can be placed almost anywhere while delivering 1500W of power. With anti-tip and over-heat protection, you'll feel comfortable leaving it on when you're not in the room.

 If the heater were to fall over if it was knocked, you'll get a notification on your phone (via the [Atomi Smart app](https://atomismart.com/app/)) to let you know it's tipped over. The heater will automatically shut off, too, for added reassurance.

 When connected to the app, the Atomi Smart Heater can be turned on and off, even if you're not at home. You can adjust the temperature, create schedules, and receive important notifications. You can also control the smart space heater at home using voice commands with Amazon Alexa and [Google Assistant](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/archiving-made-simple-saving-chatgpt-talks/).

 If, however, you don't want to use Wi-Fi, the Atomi Smart Heater can still be controlled manually. This is less convenient if you're in another room or not at home, but useful if you walk past and want to adjust the settings.

 Affordable, compact, and quiet, the Atomi Smart Heater is a powerful device that can heat up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit in seconds. It's a great investment if you are looking for a space heater that you can take with you, too, thanks to its size.

| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| ✓ Wall mountable              | ✗ Lack of oscillation      |
| ✓ Child lock                  | ✗ Not particularly stylish |
| ✓ Included remote control     |                            |

 Designed to be mounted on a wall, the [Heat Storm HS-1500-PHX-WIFI](https://www.amazon.com/Heat-Storm-HS-1500-PHX-WIFI-Infrared-Heater/dp/B07JXRWJ8D?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201951&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F888477%2Fbest-smart-space-heaters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) could easily be mistaken for an air conditioner due to its design. But don't let it fool you, as it's packed with features and can heat a 150 sq. ft. well-insulated room or even up to 1000 sq. ft. as a supplemental heat source.

 On the front of this space heater is a touchscreen control panel. You'll see the settings displayed here and can adjust the screen's brightness. Low and high heat modes are available, as is Eco mode, which lets you choose a temperature to maintain. Since this space heater is also Wi-Fi enabled, you can control the Heat Storm HS-1500 via your smartphone.

 When connected to a [2.4GHz network](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-android-without-a-wire-heres-your-free-games-list-for-2024/), you can use the companion app to control the heater. You can set the temperature and see the temperature of the heater using your smartphone, wherever you are. However, unlike some other smart space heaters, you won't be able to control the Heat Storm using a voice assistant.

 What makes the Heat Storm HS-1500-PHX-WIFI stand out is the size of the area it can heat. Boasting 5200 BTU, you can expect this heater to warm up a 150 sq. ft. room quickly and efficiently. It's an ideal smart space heater for lounges, bedrooms, or office spaces. It also features a child lock, tip-over protection, and overheat protection.

Unfortunately, it doesn't boast any smart features, so you can't connect to it via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, nor can you control it using a voice assistant or your smartphone. However, it does boast five modes and can heat up to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in just two seconds.

 Like other space heaters, the Dreo Solaris H3 Slim's Eco mode will automatically turn off when it reaches a set temperature. Alternatively, you can use the timer function to set a timer for up to 12 hours.

 Multiple safety features will reassure you if you're worried about leaving this space heater on when you're not around. This includes built-in tip-over protection, spark-proof and flame-retardant design, overheat protection, and a reinforced safety plug.

 You can't control this space heater via your smartphone, so you can use the included remote control instead. This will allow you to manage the Dreo Solaris H3 Slim up to 26 feet away. Alternatively, the panel on top of the heater allows you to adjust the controls on the cool-to-touch panel.

 Thanks to the hidden carry handle, this space heater is also extremely portable---perfect for taking on vacation or moving to different areas of your home, and suitable for covering spaces up to 270 sq. ft.

 If you're looking for an efficient and powerful space heater that won't disturb you while you sleep, this device runs at a mere 37.5dB, thanks to Dreo's ObliqueAirflow system.

### Are space heaters safe?

 Space heaters with the right safety features can help to create a warm living area without posing a danger. Choose a space heater with tip-over and overheat protection so that it will automatically shut off if there's an issue, or notify you via your smartphone.

### How much energy does a space heater use on average?

 On average, most space heaters use around 1500W per hour. They are useful in situations where you need to heat a room quickly, but not particularly energy-efficient when using them as a long-term solution.

### Can I leave a space heater on overnight?

 Space heaters that feature a timer, eco mode (where the heater automatically switches off when the desired temperature is reached), and anti-tip/overheat protection can be left on overnight. While it's preferable not to leave heaters on when you're not in the same room, most smart space heaters shouldn't be a problem.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Can I plug a smart space heater into a smart plug?

 Most smart plugs should be able to handle the load of a smart space heater. While this might not be outwardly encouraged, it's [not dangerous to plug a smart space heater into a smart plug](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-build-high-impact-facebook-ad-videos-free-creation-kit-provides-tools/).

### How do I reset a smart space heater?

 Some space heaters will feature a reset button; others may need to be unplugged for over 30 seconds, then reconnected. If you're having trouble connecting your smart space heater to its companion app, disconnect both the heater and your phone from the Wi-Fi, then try reconnecting.
