## Ultimate Selection: 2024'S Premier Video Game Platforms Unveiled

 As a big gamer, I love to check out the latest consoles, as they allow me to experience different things and discover new worlds. The best ones have great graphics and excellent online capabilities and offer an entertaining, immersive experience.

 I love the Sony PlayStation 5 because it’s speedy, looks great, and is home to some excellent exclusive games.

 My one nitpick is its bulky design, but that's been solved with its replacement: the[PS5 Slim model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4154610%7Cn581a2dc3ff9d4e12aa7563f93e0778da14%7C) , which is 30% smaller than the original and has more storage but otherwise offers the same experience.

 Pros

* Speedy and smooth playing experience
* Comfortable DualSense controller
* Plenty of exclusive games

 Cons

* Mostly need to pay to play online

**TL;DR** : Sony's latest console sports some great exclusive games and extensive media capabilities and is pretty speedy, too. It's also slimmed down from the original.

### Why We Recommend These

 The Sony PlayStation 5 is everything you could want from a games console. It’s simple to boot up and play games on with a straightforward menu system that won’t confuse you.

 While some consoles may clutter the screen or generate ads, the Sony PlayStation 5 is cleanly laid out.

 It takes moments to find the game you want or to switch to its extensive set of media options, which include all the streaming apps you can think of and the ability to play 4K Blu-rays.

 The games are varied, with something for everyone here. There are some great exclusives, with my particular highlights including God of War: Ragnarok and The Last of Us series.

 Some games are available on the PlayStation 4, but buying the latest console means much faster loading times and better graphics.

 The difference between the two is steadily growing, so now is the time to upgrade while still being able to easily check out older games.

 I really enjoyed playing games with the PS5 DualSense controller.

![PS5 controller.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AG7JE7IhgP9OyHKJb7-gYZsSc9w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/PS5controller-a37dda31e1f34f1e9867c9d21b3a239d.jpg)

Lifewire / Jennifer Allen

 It has haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, which means squeezing a trigger feels far more satisfying than with more conventional controllers without feeling a strain on your hands and joints.

 It also means you feel more in control, which is particularly satisfying when playing something like Spider-Man 2, with each swing of a web feeling more like you’re in control than just pressing a button.

 To play online, you’ll need to sign up for[PS Plus](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-playstation-plus-4772152)  for most games (free-to-play titles like Fortnite are exempt), but it’s worth the annual membership, given how seamlessly it works.

**Who else recommends it?** Digital Trends, Popular Mechanics, TechRadar, and Wirecutter all recommend the Sony PlayStation 5.

**What do buyers say?** 91% of nearly 8,000 Amazon reviewers rate the Sony PlayStation 5 five stars.

 Pros

* Ultraportable
* Different color options
* Comfy build

 Cons

* Can’t dock it to the TV
* Some Switch games are not compatible

**TL;DR** : Cute, colorful, and with plenty of games, the Nintendo Switch Lite is a great budget-friendly console.

### Why We Recommend This

 The Nintendo Switch Lite is an incredibly cute-looking handheld console.

 It’s designed to be more child-friendly than a Switch and has a thick plastic casing that makes it far more durable.

 That means a choice of fun color schemes (I’m a fan of yellow and aquamarine blue), but it also means that the Nintendo Switch Lite is comfy to hold. As someone with joint issues, I’ve found the console molds perfectly in my hands, even over many hours.

 It has a smaller screen than the standard Nintendo Switch, but games continue to run in 720p, so it still looks pretty good. There’s no performance drop here—just a more petite build.

 I played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and it was still excellent fun and immersive. Exploring the console is straightforward and clearly laid out, so newcomers and children can quickly figure out what to do.

 Games can be bought digitally or as physical cartridges. The console has 32GB of internal storage, which can always be upgraded with a microSD card.

Lifewire / Jennifer Allen

 That’s not to say that concessions aren’t made here. The Nintendo Switch Lite can’t be docked like its bigger sibling, missing out on one of the reasons why it’s called a Switch.

 Because of that, the Joy-Con controllers can’t be detached, so you’ll need to buy a separate controller to attempt to play multiplayer on the small screen.

 Also, the lack of unattached Joy-Con controllers means no motion controls, which can affect many games.

 Despite that, the Nintendo Switch Lite is an ideal entry point to gaming as it’s so easy to use.

**Who else recommends it?** TechRadar, Digital Trends, GamesRadar, and Wirecutter all recommend the Nintendo Switch Lite. (You can[read our review here](https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-lite-review-4788015) .)

**What do buyers say?** 90% of 54,000 Amazon ratings give the Nintendo Switch Lite five stars.

## How We Test

 I reviewed every game console based on the following attributes:

* Setup
* Daily use
* Games available
* Accessories supported
* How user-friendly they are

 I purchased all the consoles tested for my personal use. During my time with them, I spent dozens of hours comparing them.

 That included seeing how quickly each console loaded and allowed me to immediately play a game and how simple it was to do so.

 I also looked at the number of games available for each system, any advantages they offer, and whether the controller felt comfortable and intuitive to use.

 I also considered possibly the most critical factor -- how much fun it was to play on each console, which made me want to return for more.

##

 What to Look For

 Buying a games console is never a cheap proposition, so buying the right one for you and your needs is essential, rather than making a mistake.

 To help you figure out which game console is best for you, consider these key things before you buy:

**Who’s playing?**

 All game consoles have a variety of games aimed at different age groups, but some are better for certain players than others.

 For instance, PlayStation has many hard-hitting single-player experiences with stories exploring adult themes. It may also have games like Bluey and the Lego titles, but its strength is in more adult titles.

 Alternatively, the Nintendo Switch has the Mario franchise, which is very family-friendly. Many couch co-op and multiplayer titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, offer a more sociable experience.

**Compatibility**

 Do you already own a console? That can affect what your next one should be.

 Almost all Xbox One accessories work with the Xbox Series X/S, so if you already have some controllers or a headset, it makes sense to stick with the same ecosystem.

 Also, if you have digital or physical copies of games, it’s worth checking if you can still play those on the new console.

 The PS5 plays PS4 games, and the Xbox Series X/S plays Xbox One games; however, the Switch isn’t backward compatible with the Nintendo Wii U.

**Convenience**

 Some consoles are more portable than others. Something like the Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 will live under your TV or next to your monitor and can’t easily be transported elsewhere.

 The Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck work portably and are docked to a screen. It’s worth considering how important portability is for you. Generally, consoles that solely work via a TV or monitor tend to be more powerful, but you miss out on quickly taking it out with you.

 The newest gaming consoles can be pricey, but you don’t have to spend much for an exciting gaming experience. For instance, Nintendo’s consoles, on average, cost about $100 less than many of its competitors. You can also find great deals on classic systems.

 If you’ve previously owned a gaming console, you should consider buying a new one compatible with the library of games you’ve likely collected.

 For example, newer PlayStations won’t play games from older Sony consoles, but you can still access hundreds of older PlayStation titles using the PS Now streaming service.

 On the other hand, Xbox consoles have much better backward compatibility, not to mention a digital redemption scheme that lets you download newer versions of your existing games for free.

 How important is it to you to be able to play your favorite games in true 4K? If your answer is “very,” you’ll want a console that supports 2160p or higher, but if your answer is “not really,” you can settle for something else. The same goes for virtual reality, as not all systems will support it.

 FAQ

* Do you need a stable internet connection to use these consoles?  
 While gaming consoles rely on an internet connection for much of their functionality, having a stable connection isn't essential. However, not connecting your console will severely hamper its features and your overall enjoyment. Besides being unable to play with your friends online, you won't get updates for your console or games, purchase or download games digitally, or access the multitudes of free games that typically become available over a console's lifetime.
* Can you upgrade your consoles?  
 Modern consoles have a limited upgrade capacity, usually restricted to storage and aesthetics. Unfortunately, there is no way to install granular upgrades like you would see with a gaming PC, but you still have the option to increase your storage space or swap its color for something more palatable.
