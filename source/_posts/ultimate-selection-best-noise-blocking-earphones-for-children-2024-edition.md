##  What to Look For in Noise-Cancelling Headphones for Kids

 Most headphones made for children (and every set we picked for this guide) feature a built-in volume limiter. This means that the headphones can't go higher than a set [decibel](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-youtube-playbacks-with-timestamps/) level. In most cases, this limit is 85dB, generally considered the [limit for safe listening](https://techidaily.com/complete-tutorial-for-motorola-moto-g24-hard-reset-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/).

 Then you need to consider whether you're looking for [active noise cancellation (ANC)](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-sharing-twitch-on-your-fb-page-for-2024/), or simply passive noise isolation. Passive isolation comes from the seal the ear pads form around your child's ears and will somewhat protect them from loud outside noises. Conversely, ANC won't protect hearing but is more effective at reducing surrounding noise.

 Of course, while this is important, these factors won't matter to kids. They'll be much more interested in how the headphones look than how they sound or how safe they are. Most of the headphones we're looking at here come in various [colorways](https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-updated-interview-playbook-for-audience-allure-for-2024/) to make any child happy.

 Finally, there's the matter of whether you're looking for wireless headphones or wired ones. Typically, wireless headphones are more convenient, and you don't have to worry about a cable that could snag or snap. On the other hand, Wired headphones may be easier to damage, but they're also more affordable and easier to start using.

 Altec Lansing may not be the first brand you think of when you think of noise cancelling headphones, or headphones for kids. That said, the [Altec Lansing Kid Safe Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Altec-Lansing-Cancelling-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CB8XS917?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offer solid noise cancellation, volume limited to protect young ears, and a large enough variety of fun colors that any kid should be able to choose their favorite.

 The ANC in these Altec Lansing headphones helps kids focus or relax in busy areas like airports, but it’s protecting their hearing that is more important. These feature a built-in volume limit of 85 decibels to make sure that kids can’t crank up the volume further than they should. The headphones feature Bluetooth, but they also work as wired headphones with the included cable.

 The headphones are sized to fit kids from ages 7 and up, and they use a foldable design. Unlike many kids' headphones, these are [IPX4 water-resistant](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). This means that they can stand the occasional splash or a brief bit of rain, but they won’t stand up to being submerged. Plush ear cushions keep them extra comfortable.

 Altec Lansing claims a battery life of up to 15 hours, which is plenty of time for music or videos. If the battery does run out, kids can plug in with the included cable and not have to worry about the battery at all.

 These headphones come in four black finishes and six white finishes, all of which you can see on the Amazon store page. The black models include [Blackout Funky Green](https://www.amazon.com/Altec-Lansing-Cancelling-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CB8VYW16?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Blackout Purple](https://www.amazon.com/Altec-Lansing-Cancelling-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CB8Y83NH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), while the white finishes include [Whiteout Groovy Orange](https://www.amazon.com/Altec-Lansing-Cancelling-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CB91GB99?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Whiteout Pop Pink](https://www.amazon.com/Altec-Lansing-Cancelling-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CB91GB99?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [Whiteout Wave Blue](https://www.amazon.com/Altec-Lansing-Cancelling-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CB8WQVKX?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ✓ Smaller fit aimed at younger kids | ✗ No active noise cancellation |

| ✓ Decent noise isolation            |                                |

 If you're buying headphones for a younger or smaller child, you may want to consider the [JLab Audio JBuddies Studio](https://www.amazon.com/JBuddies-Bluetooth-Wireless-Folding-Headphones/dp/B071VJSH3N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). These are sized down compared to adult headphones and even some kids' headphones, making them a better fit for those who need a smaller size.

 These headphones use an on-ear design, which should help them stay in place better than over-ear headphones. The headband is adjustable for a better fit, and the JLab Audio JBuddies Studio also features a pinch-free hinge design to prevent kids from hurting themselves when adjusting the cups.

 With these being smaller, they don't have as much space for a larger battery. That said, they still feature up to 13 hours of battery life. You don't get active noise cancellation with these, though the ear cups' design provides decent noise isolation.

 The JLab Audio JBuddies Studio headphones are available in [purple](https://www.amazon.com/JBuddies-Bluetooth-Wireless-Folding-Headphones/dp/B071VJSH3N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [blue](https://www.amazon.com/JBuddies-Bluetooth-Headphones-Adjustable-Isolation/dp/B0722VFVLW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) colors.

Best Noise-Isolating Headphones for Smaller Kids

#####  JLab Audio JBuddies Studio

Headphones meant for adults simply don't fit kids, which is why these feature a smaller size for an easier fit on younger and smaller kids, along with decent passive noise isolation.

| ✓ Look is suited to both younger and older kids | ✗ Pricey compared to other options |
| ✓ Great ANC for the price                       |                                    |
| ✓ 23 hour battery life with ANC                 |                                    |
| ✓ 3.5mm audio cable included for wired use      |                                    |

 Wireless headphones are more important than ever, even for children. More and more devices are nixing the headphone jack, so it's important to get noise-cancelling headphones that will work with a variety of devices, and the [PuroQuiet Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Puro-Sound-Labs-Microphone-Safer-Studio-Grade/dp/B0CP4NXVQ4?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) headphones are great wired and wireless.

 An upgraded version of our previous pick, the PuroQuiet Plus offers fantastic noise cancellation, and it can be used with Bluetooth to provide a wireless experience. The headphones won't run out of battery quickly, either—you'll get about 23 hours with ANC on, and up to 35 hours without. If the device has a headphone jack, you can also plug the Puro Sound Labs headphones in and you won't need to worry about the battery.

 Most importantly, the PuroQuiet Plus offers all the essential safety features for children. The volume can't go above the 85 dB sound level which is dangerous for young hearing, and with the ANC, they won't feel the need to go louder. The big downside to these headphones are the price, at over $100 it can be hard to recommend if your child isn't careful with electronics. For older children, however, these headphones are a great investment.

 There are a few special aspects to the [ONANOFF BuddyPhones Cosmos+](https://www.amazon.com/BuddyPhones-Cancelling-Headphones-Detachable-Microphone/dp/B095RJ92DQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) headphones. First, there are the bold designs and multiple color options, then there's the included boom microphone, which is handy for kids enrolled in online learning.

 These headphones are meant for a wide range of ages, as you can tell by the multiple volume limits. There is a 75dB limit meant for toddlers, an 85dB mode for kids, and a 94dB travel mode intended for noisier environments like vehicles.

 These are mainly wireless headphones, and they include ANC. That said, they can also work in wired mode. This is handy for wired listening, but it seems it's mainly intended for using the headset in a virtual classroom scenario, giving the headphones some extra utility.

 ONANOFF BuddyPhones Cosmos+ are available in six color varieties, inlcuding [Snow White](https://www.amazon.com/BuddyPhones-Cancelling-Headphones-Detachable-Microphone/dp/B095RJ92DQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Grey Matter](https://www.amazon.com/BuddyPhones-Cancelling-Headphones-Detachable-Microphone/dp/B095RNJT2F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [Sun Yellow](https://www.amazon.com/BuddyPhones-Cancelling-Headphones-Detachable-Microphone/dp/B095RR7NGP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 If your kids have a destructive side, or they're growing quickly, and you would rather not invest in a more expensive set of headphones, the [LilGadgets Connect+](https://www.amazon.com/LilGadgets-Connect-Headphones-SharePort-Children/dp/B00Q3I68T0?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) are a great option. They're super affordable, come in various colors, and are a perfect fit for younger kids.

 These are the only wired-online headphones here, but they use a removable cable that protects them from snags. The headphones don't feature active noise cancellation, but they do have passive noise isolation from the relatively large ear pads.

 It's worth noting that the volume limit in the LilGadgets Connect+ is slightly higher than normal at 93dB. This means that they'll work as well in noisy environments as in quiet rooms, but you also may need to keep a closer eye and ensure nobody is listening too loudly.

 You'll find the LilGadgets Connect+ in six colors: [green](https://www.amazon.com/LilGadgets-Connect-Headphones-SharePort-Children/dp/B00Q3I68T0?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [black](https://www.amazon.com/LilGadgets-Connect-Headphones-SharePort-Children/dp/B01AN91U92?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [blue](https://www.amazon.com/LilGadgets-Connect-Headphones-SharePort-Children/dp/B00Q3I690I?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [pink](https://www.amazon.com/LilGadgets-Connect-Headphones-SharePort-Children/dp/B00Q3I690I?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [purple](https://www.amazon.com/LilGadgets-Connect-Headphones-SharePort-Children/dp/B00Q3I68TU?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [red](https://www.amazon.com/LilGadgets-Connect-Headphones-SharePort-Children/dp/B07Y2FB76Z?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [blue / purple](https://www.amazon.com/LilGadgets-Connect-Headphones-SharePort-Children/dp/B07Y2FB76Z?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202064&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F886428%2Fbest-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

### Are noise-cancelling headphones safe for kids?

 Yes. The only danger from noise-cancelling headphones is turning them up to loud, and the volume limits in kids headphones mean that this isn’t a danger.

### Why should kids use noise-cancelling headphones?

 Many of the same benefits of noise-cancelling headphones for adults are true for kids as well. They can help your kids focus and concentrate as well as help them relax.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### What noise level is too loud for kids?

 Similarly to adults, 85 decibels is the threshold for safe listening. Beyond this, prolonged exposure can cause hearing damage. This is why kids’ headphones are typically volume limited not to go beyond 85dB.
