##  What to Look For in Headphones in 2023

 One of the first and most important decisions you need to make for any pair of headphones is whether you want them to be wired or wireless. Wireless headphones give you more freedom of movement, but they also cost more and require frequent recharging. Wired headphones are less convenient but more affordable, and they offer better sound quality.

 The second thing you'll want to keep in mind is noise. [Active noise cancellation](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-sharing-twitch-on-your-fb-page-for-2024/) can be essential if you work in a busy office or have a long public commute. On the other hand, it adds to the cost of the headphones, and depending on how it's implemented, can have a negative effect on sound quality.

 The majority of headphones we're looking at use a closed-back design, which means anyone nearby won't be able to hear what you're listening to, at least at a reasonable volume. Open-back headphones are just that---the back of the headphone is exposed. This makes for a more expansive, wider sound, but anyone around you will faintly hear whatever you're listening to.

 Depending on the headphones you're looking at, some may have larger and smaller drivers. Don't let the name confuse you---most over-ear and on-ear headphones use dynamic drivers, which are just small speakers next to your ear. These are frequently 40mm or 50mm in size, but you may see larger or smaller numbers.

 Larger drivers often deliver more bass thanks to the extra size, but this doesn't mean larger drivers always have more bass. Studio headphones and headphones that strive for a more accurate frequency response frequently use larger drivers but don't overemphasize bass.

 Finally, if you're looking for headphones for gaming, there are a few extra details to watch out for. Positional audio is important for gaming headphones, as is a mic to communicate with others when you're playing online.

##  Best Budget Headphones Overall: [Philips SHP9600](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-SHP9600-Headphones-Open-Back-00/dp/B08B477BHS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206929&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F785504%2Fbest-budget-headphones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term)

| Pros                                              | Cons                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Open-back design makes for wide, spacious sound | ✗ Others nearby will hear what you're listening to |
| ✓ Solid build with a steel-reinforced headband    |                                                    |
| ✓ Comfortable for hours at a time                 |                                                    |

 Our overall pick focuses on sound quality and audio performance over fancy features. That's why we chose the [Philips SHP9600](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-SHP9600-Headphones-Open-Back-00/dp/B08B477BHS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206929&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F785504%2Fbest-budget-headphones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), a set of open-back, wired headphones that are going to do justice to your favorite music, regardless of what you listen to.

 The Philips SHP9600 is built around 50mm drivers. These are 32 [Ohm](https://driver-install.techidaily.com/tips-to-automate-amd-drivers-installationupdates/) headphones, so you'll have plenty of power and volume even if you're using them with your phone.

 Philips tuned the drivers to be fairly neutral, so while the headphones offer plenty of bass, it doesn't come at the expense of the treble or midrange frequencies. While this is great for music, it also works well for movies, TV shows, and YouTube videos.

 Unlike some affordable headphones, the Philips SHP9600 uses a steel-reinforced headband instead of plastic. This means these should hold up to repeated use without failing. Don't worry about the metal being uncomfortable, though, as the headband features double-layered padding.

 This is one of the most barebones headphones we're looking at, but all the money Philips saved by not adding Bluetooth or noise cancellation goes directly to the audio performance. If that's what you care most about in headphones, don't miss the Philips SHP9000.

| ✓ Great sound whether you're using your phone or a headphone amp | ✗ Third-party ear pads are necessary for optimal comfort |
| ✓ Comfortable headband design                                    | ✗ Long cable makes portable use difficult                |

 In case you're not familiar with the brand, Monoprice started out as a company selling cheap cables and other accessories. The company garnered such a good reputation and branched out, and now they've also become a player in the headphone world.

 The [Monoprice Modern Retro](https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Headphones-Ultra-Comfortable-Perfect-Production/dp/B01M7Z0VKR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206929&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F785504%2Fbest-budget-headphones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) headphones are some of the best you can get in their price range, and they even surpass some models three times their price or more.

 As the name implies, the Monoprice Modern Retro has a throwback look, but the sound is anything but dated. Like the [Philips SHP9600](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-digital-chronicles-cutting-edge-methods-for-saving-your-vr-gaming-journey/), these headphones feature 50mm drivers, with an [impedance](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-harmonizing-tech-and-artistry-mac-studios/) of 32 Ohms. While they're not quite as sensitive as the Philips, Monoprice's offering is still easy to drive with a phone.

 These are a wired pair of budget headphones, and the one downside that comes from their budget build is that the cable is built-in and not replaceable. It's also nearly 10 feet long, which is great if you're listening at home, but this can be cumbersome if you're using them with your phone.

 Out of the box, the stock earpads aren't the best. That said, the [Brainwavz XL Large Replacement Memory Foam Earpads](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076SGPZ2D?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206929&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F785504%2Fbest-budget-headphones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) are a quality replacement that vastly improves these headphones. With a quick pad swap, the Monoprice Modern Retro easily rivals headphones costing much more.

 If you prefer not to swap ear pads, the stock pads are fine, but not only are replacement ear pads a massive upgrade in comfort, but they are also available in a variety of colors to personalize your headphones.

| Good ANC for the price         |                             |

 As noise-cancelling technology improves, ANC is getting better and better in more budget-priced headphones, putting them more in line with higher-end headphones from a few years ago. The [1MORE SonoFlow](https://www.amazon.com/1MORE-SonoFlow-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0B7NBXWDV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206929&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F785504%2Fbest-budget-headphones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) headphones are affordable and pack solid ANC, but there’s a lot more that makes them worth a recommendation as well.

 The SonoFlow headphones connect via Bluetooth 5.0, and in addition to the usual SBC and AAC codecs, they also support LDAC. This is a higher quality codec, but it’s not available on iPhone or iPad, and it’s rare even on Android devices. Still, the extra compatibility and potential for higher sound quality is nice to have.

 A pair of 40mm drivers provides the sound, with plenty of size to deliver bass frequencies. Using the 1MORE MUSIC app (available for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices), you can switch between 12 onboard EQ settings. These include a Podcast setting, which is perfect for listening to podcasts or watching videos.

 While the noise cancellation isn’t up to par with flagship offerings from companies like Sony or Bose, it’s still effective. In our review of the SonoFlow, we found that the headphones would let lower frequencies like passing trucks through, but was effective at suppressing higher frequencies. The headphones also feature a transparent mode to let you hear your surroundings better.

 The battery life is impressive. 1MORE claims up to 50 hours of playtime with ANC, or up to 70 without ANC. They also support fast charging, so a five-minute charge will get you up to five hours of extra listening time.

 Jabra has been pumping out rock-solid wireless headphones and earbuds for longer than many of its competitors, and the company has only gotten better at it over time. Proof lies in the [Jabra Elite 45h](https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-Titanium-Black-Ear/dp/B0865439LD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206929&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F785504%2Fbest-budget-headphones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), a great-sounding, portable set of budget Bluetooth headphones.

 Due to the smaller build and on-ear design, the Jabra Elite 45h uses a 40 mm driver, but it sounds anything but small. Thanks to the smaller size, these are headphones you can take out on a walk, and you don't need to worry about getting caught in the rain, since these are [rain-resistant](https://www.reviewgeek.com/62529/ip-ratings-explained-what-does-the-code-mean-for-your-devices/).

 The Jabra Elite 45h headphones don't offer noise cancellation, but they do allow you to customize your listening experience. With the [Jabra Sound+ App](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU206929/https://www.jabra.com/software-and-services/apps/jabra-sound-plus), you can use the MySound feature to tailor the sound to your individual hearing profile.

 Battery life also won't be a problem with the Jabra Elite 45h. The company claims playback time up to 50 hours, and if that's not enough, a 15-minute charge will get you 10 more hours of listening.

 Too many headphones only ship in a single color option, but that's not the case with the Jabra Elite 45h. In addition to the standard black option, you can also choose between [Gold Beige](https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-Titanium-Black-Ear/dp/B086T3RYQP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206929&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F785504%2Fbest-budget-headphones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and [Navy Blue](https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-Titanium-Black-Ear/dp/B086T3ZJZV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206929&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F785504%2Fbest-budget-headphones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) if you prefer your headphones with a splash of color.

 The Razer Kraken has been a popular choice among gaming headsets for quite a while now, but while it’s relatively affordable compared to many other headsets, the price isn’t right for everyone. The [Razer Kraken X](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kraken-Ultralight-Gaming-Headset/dp/B07RMSM477/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206929&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F785504%2Fbest-budget-headphones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is the company’s more affordable version of its popular gaming headset, but while it may be a budget version, it’s not a major step down.

 No matter which system you plan to use the Razer Kraken X with, chances are good that it’s supported. In addition to PC, the headset works with the Sony PlayStation 4 and Playstation 5, Microsoft’s Xbox Series X|S consoles and the Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch.

 That list is of the platforms that are officially supported, but the Razer Kraken X’s simple connectivity means the headset is compatible with anything with a 3.5mm headphone jack. You also get a splitter cable that separates into separate audio and microphone connectors for even more compatibility.

 Unlike the Kraken, which mounts the controls on the cable, the Kraken X sees the controls mounted on the headset itself. This headset also uses 40mm drivers compared to the 50mm drivers in the Kraken, and the built-in microphone is bendable but not retractable as it is on the Kraken.

 Like the Kraken, the Kraken X is available in a variety of colors, including [White](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kraken-Ultralight-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09SK66MCS/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206929&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F785504%2Fbest-budget-headphones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Black / Green](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kraken-Ultralight-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09SJWCKL4/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206929&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F785504%2Fbest-budget-headphones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), and [Classic Black](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kraken-Ultralight-Gaming-Headset/dp/B07RMC5BRL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206929&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F785504%2Fbest-budget-headphones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 Sure, budget headphones can deliver when casually listening to music or watching a video, but what about when you’re working on something with audio? Can you actually rely on budget headphones to deliver an accurate audio image to your ears? When it comes to the [Superlux HD 681](https://www.amazon.com/Superlux-681-Dynamic-Semi-Open-Headphones/dp/B002GHIPYI?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206929&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F785504%2Fbest-budget-headphones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), the answer is an easy yes.

 The HD 681 headphones sure get the studio look right, with a design similar to the classic AKG K240 studio headphones. The steel wire and plastic build is relatively sturdy but also lightweight enough that you won’t feel them after long sessions. The red and black color scheme isn’t for everyone, but it’s not overly flashy either.

 As is often the case with budget-oriented headphones, the padding in the ear cups leaves something to be desired. The good news is that plenty of third-party ear pads on the market will provide not just an upgrade in comfort, but in sound as well. These aren’t expensive, and it’s nice to know that even if you like the stock pads, they’re easy to replace if they wear out.

 The HD 681 headphones use a semi-open design. This can lead to leaking sound into a microphone (known as “bleed”) if you’re recording. The semi-open design gives the headphones a wider soundstage than most closed-back headphones. This, combined with the surprisingly neutral sound signature, makes these perfect for mixing or critical listening.

 As is often the case with studio headphones, the cable is longer than you may expect, at around nine feet. The only downside is that the cable isn’t replaceable, so you’ll need to be careful not to trip over it.

## FAQ

### How do I clean my headphones?

 Cleaning your headphones from time to time is a great way to keep them fresh and remove any unwanted germs. The good news is, it's safe to clean your headphones with household items like isopropyl alcohol, cotton swabs, and paper towels. Check out our full guide on headphone and earbud cleaning for more info.

### Are Bluetooth headphones safe?

 While you may have heard that Bluetooth headphones emit electromagnetic radiation (EMR), this is nothing to worry about. The minuscule amount of EMR your headphones transmit is harmless, meaning Bluetooth headphones are perfectly safe to use. In fact, several medical studies have found Bluetooth devices to be safer than smartphones (Effect of Bluetooth headset and mobile phone electromagnetic fields on the human auditory nerve, Effects of Bluetooth device electromagnetic field on hearing: pilot study).

### Why are my headphones not working?

 This could be the result of a number of roadblocks. First, identify that your headphones are able to connect to your device. For example, make sure your headphones have remaining battery life, Bluetooth is enabled on your smartphone, and your headphones are paired and connected. If they're wired, try connecting them to another device.

 If you notice a secure connection, but no audio comes through, you may be dealing with a bigger issue. Verify your headphones don't work by connecting them to another device and making sure the volume is high enough to hear. At this point, if your headphones still aren't working, you'll need to dig deeper into the manufacturer's support resources, or request a replacement if they're covered by a warranty.

### Are headphones better than earbuds?

 Neither device is "better" than the other. They serve different purposes; for instance, earbuds are compact and extremely easy to transport. They're perfect for car rides, plane flights, and impromptu workout sessions. Headphones, on the other hand, typically offer the best audio quality available. They also stand a good chance of being more comfortable thanks to their ear cups and padding. They're excellent for desktop setups, audiophiles on the go, and those who hate sticking anything in their ear.

### Can headphones dent your head?

 No, your skull will not form a dent due to headphone usage. If you have long or curly hair, though, you will likely see some "headphone hair" effects in that department. There's no real way to avoid headphone hair, you just have to deal with it after you're done wearing your headphones.
