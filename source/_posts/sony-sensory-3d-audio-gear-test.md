## Top Audio Headphones, No Cords

 Wireless earbuds have come a long way in the last five years. When Apple cut off the cable from its ubiquitous EarPods, which came with all iPhones, the rest of the market followed suit with an onslaught of truly wireless earbuds.

 Nowadays, choosing earbuds in this category can be daunting. So I’m here to help. I’ve spent the better part of the last two weeks with a backpack full of the top earbud choices on the market—streaming video content on the train, listening to Top 40 radio at the gym, and more—and here’s how I think things stack up.

 The Rundown

**TL;DR:** The Apple AirPods Pro remain one of the best all-around earbud offerings for everyone (not just Apple users) thanks to impressive spatial audio, incredible noise cancellation, and a full feature set.

### Why We Recommend These

 Apple has a knack for delving into new categories and completely taking over as if it were a crucial player from the beginning. Nearly any entry in the AirPods line could find a spot on this list thanks to stellar build quality and seamless connectivity alone, but the AirPods Pro live up to their Pro distinction with many extras.

 First, noise cancellation and audio quality. Apple has clearly invested countless sums into audio research to provide some of the best adaptive noise cancellation around. It successfully canceled out dull room noise from a loud HVAC system and loud, sporadic sounds like chatter in a busy coffee shop.

 Pros

* Excellent active noise cancellation
* Impressive adaptive audio
* Solid build quality and design

 Cons

* **No ear wings**
* Battery life slightly shorter than advertised
* Fairly expensive

 The sound quality in play is also impressive, thanks in part to Apple’s new Adaptive and Spatial Audio features that map the sound to your surroundings and ear shape. Thanks to the H2 chip, the impressive computing pedigree that makes Apple computers and mobile devices so impressive is now on display here.

 I found that every style of music I threw at the AirPods shined very well—so whether you’re into classic rock, hip-hop, audiobooks, and more, you’ll be happy here.

 Then there’s the build quality, fit, and finish. From the satisfying snap of the battery case to how the earbuds feel, the high price tag is undoubtedly supported by the build quality.

 I do find that I like the way Bose earbuds fit into my ears a bit better thanks to the rubber wings they usually include, but if you’re comfortable with a bullet-style ear tip, the AirPods Pro will fit well.

Lifewire / Jason Schneider

 Another thing to note is that while Apple promises up to 30 hours of use with the included battery case, I was trending close to 20–25\. This wasn’t a big deal because that’s still an impressive total, but the battery life will likely be lower than advertised in real-life use.

 But all in all, if you like the design and form factor here, the features will also be evident, and you’ll find that the AirPods Pro will deliver across the board.

* **Who else recommends it?** You won’t have to look far to find other favorable reviews here: PC Mag, CNET, The Verge, Sound Guys, and the list goes on.
* **What do buyers think?** Over 300,000 people have rated the AirPods Pro an average of 4.7 stars on Amazon—a truly impressive aggregate from a wide array of average consumers.

**TL;DR:** Bose is back at it with a clean, focused approach to both audio quality and noise cancellation—now with a new design and a comparatively reasonable price tag.

### Why We Recommend These

 If you're looking for active noise cancellation, you’ll want to focus on Bose’s line of earbuds. From the QuietComfort Earbuds several years ago, I’ve always found Bose’s tailored, adaptive approach to noise cancellation to be the most natural and pleasant to my ears.

 Its latest offering, the QC Ultra Earbuds, carries that torch silently into most situations. I used my QC Ultras in various situations—noisy train stations, on a run in a nearby busy neighborhood, and even at night trying to fall asleep while my wife watched TV. In all cases, the earbuds elegantly blotted out sound without affecting the music I was listening to.

 Pros

* Excellent, natural sounding noise cancellation
* Solid sound quality with customization
* Beautiful design and build
* Nice fit

 Cons

* Limited battery life with the case
* Experienced some minor Bluetooth hiccups

 Speaking of which, the sound quality here was impressive across all the genres I frequent. The audio response for rock and pop was solid—adding a nice sparkle to Taylor Swift’s latest album. I also found the QC Ultras shine with podcasts, which deliver a pleasant focus and definition to the spoken voice.

 That’s all thanks to Bose’s approach to equalization right out of the box, but you can use the Bose Music app to tailor that sound to your liking.

 The package on offer is impressive, too. The high-quality case snaps shut quickly (a big step up from the clasped approach used in previous Bose earbuds), and the little rubber ear wings that poke up and grab the outside of your ear helped to keep the earbuds inside my ears.

 The six hours of battery life within the earbuds themselves is impressive, but the case only consistently provides an additional 10 to 12 hours, so these aren’t class leaders in that category. I noticed one or two minor Bluetooth connectivity hiccups when walking around people with many Bluetooth devices.

 However, for the ANC experience and sound quality alone, the QC Ultras are well worth the admission price. They are almost half the price of Apple’s premium offering.

Lifewire / Jason Schneider

* **Who else recommends it?** Like many of the brand’s other products, most flagship tech publications—including CNET, The Sound Guys, The Verge, and more—find the Bose sound quality and ANC here nearly unmatched.
* **What do buyers think?** Buyers on Amazon give these earbuds a high rating for their sound quality and noise-canceling ability.

**TL;DR:** A rich sound profile, truly top-tier battery life, and unique design choices make the Liberty 4 NC an easy purchase for the budget-minded.

### Why We Recommend These

 For years, I’ve been a fan of Soundcore’s approach, which strikes a nice balance between budget-friendly price points and surprisingly good-sounding speakers and headphones. And it’s no surprise to see that level of focus with a parent company like Anker. The Liberty 4 NCs offer an excellent next generation to this pedigree.

 Pros

* Wallet-friendly price
* Solid sound and active noise cancelation
* Fun design and colors
* Standout battery life

 Cons

* Sound isn't as good as Apple or Bose
* Plastic construction leaves a bit to be desired

 The first thing I noticed was their design: a nice set of colors on offer (the sky blue pair I got is particularly fun) and a fun combo of glossy and matte surfaces. I even like the angled way the earbuds sit in their case, as they’re easier to remove than some other styles of battery charging case.

 Speaking of battery, this is one of the standout features.

 The earbuds pack about 10 hours of listening on a single charge—an impressive total that seemed accurate in my tests. But when you pop them back into the charging case, you can top them up and keep them going for up to 50 hours of battery life.

 While I was trending closer to 40 hours, providing functionality and reliability for an entire workday is nothing to sneeze at.

 Then there’s the sound quality. I wasn’t surprised to find a balanced spectrum that perhaps leaned too much into the bass side of things. I found it particularly effective for rock mixes, providing power and detail. There’s also impressive adaptive noise cancellation on offer, which kept me focused while working in a noisy coffee shop.

Lifewire / Jason Schneider

 Of course, you won’t find quite the premium sound processing as you will on more expensive offerings from Apple or Bose. However, for the price, the Liberty 4s are truly impressive. The build does, admittedly, feel a little plastic-y—which helps keep them lightweight but does take away from any possible premium feel. Whether you’re on a budget or not, the Liberty 4 NCs will deliver.  

* **Who else recommends it?** Independent product testers tend to love Soundcore’s approach to headphones, and the Liberty 4 NCs are no exception, with solid marks from The Sound Guys, PC Mag, RTINGS, and more.
* **What do buyers think?** Thousands of Amazon users highly rate these earbuds for their price, comfort, and sound.

## How I Test Earbuds

 Wireless earbuds are measured on their performance as well as their feature offering. Here’s how I tend to break things down

* Sound quality and active noise cancellation performance
* Design and build quality
* Extra features, like battery life and app customization

 If you search my author page on Lifewire, you’ll see that I have reviewed many earbuds over the years. While this helps me guide readers to make an informed decision, earbuds can be a particularly personal preference.

 I also draw on my music technology background and focus on real-world applications to help you decide.

 Want to know the best active noise cancellation? I tested these on trains and busy streets. Want to have the best possible sound quality? I’ll identify the sound style and where it's best.

## What to Look For

 As wireless earbuds have become increasingly ubiquitous in consumer audio, brands have started packing more features into their products. As such, it’s become more difficult than ever to determine what’s most important on the spec sheet.

 That would be essential if noise cancellation is crucial for your focus time. But if you want long, reliable battery life, you may be willing to sacrifice that ANC on those grounds.
