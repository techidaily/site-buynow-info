##  Key Considerations When Choosing an 13-Inch iPad Air Case

 The [6th generation of the iPad Air](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/optimizing-fallout-4-performance-for-lightning-fast-loads/) is the first of the series to include a [13-inch model](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D3J59856?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003179&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This size increase will please tablet users who have a preference for a larger screen. However, for new buyers, this might mean a new protective case is also on the cards.

 There are some quality protective cases specifically designed for this new tablet that offer precise cutouts and moldings. These tend to be a little pricier. But, some older[iPad Pro 12.9-inch cases](https://fox-http.techidaily.com/a-comparative-look-at-rgb-and-srgb-for-designers/) (5th- and 6th-gen models) will likely still fit the 13-inch iPad Air just as well, as the only difference in dimensions is that the iPad Air is 0.01 inches thinner.

 Another thing new iPad Air 13-inch owners should be aware of is that the tablet does not support the Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) or earlier. It supports the new [Apple Pencil Pro](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D3J71RM7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003179&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Apple Pencil (USB-C)](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CL7J12YK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003179&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) only. This may cause frustration among new iPad Air owners. Nevertheless, the Apple Pencil Pro does have [significant upgrades](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-realme-c33-2023-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), especially for creative types, so it may be worth trading in that 2nd-gen stylus and investing in this newest iteration.

 Having a dedicated slot to store and charge your Apple Pencil Pro is a handy feature to look out for. If the slot offers a secure fit, it gives peace of mind to those who worry about losing an expensive accessory. It also means you don’t need to remove the case to charge it.

 But, when searching for a protective case for your 13-inch iPad Air, you may notice that some sellers state their case to be compatible with the Apple Pencil (2nd Generation). However, this does not mean you cannot charge your Apple Pencil Pro using these cases because the two Apple Pencils are precisely the same size. It will slot into the space just as snugly as previous generations and charge as normal.

 You’ll also want to check the case for durability. It’s always best to look at which materials it is made from. Most consist of [thermoplastic polyurethane](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/), or TPU for short. It’s a flexible yet durable plastic that is ubiquitous in the modern era. Still, it’s always best to check customer reviews before splashing out your hard-earned cash.

 Being an official Apple accessory, the [Smart Folio for iPad Air](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWKD3ZM/A/smart-folio-for-ipad-air-13-inch-m2-light-violet) is the best option to ensure compatibility and quality. It’s specifically designed for the 13-inch iPad Air and offers protection against bumps, scratches, and spills in style thanks to its range of four eye-catching colors.

 The case blends elegance with durability thanks to its robust polyurethane material and soft microfiber lining. The Smart Folio also has a precise fit that guarantees good protection on both the front and back of your tablet and perfect accessibility to your device’s ports and buttons.

 Another nice feature of the Smart Folio for iPad Air is its intelligent wake/sleep function. It maximizes battery life and efficiency by automatically waking up when you open the case and sending your device back to sleep when you close it.

 While originally designed for the iPad Pro 12.9-inch, the[GILLKEN Folio Protective Case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN2W8B27?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003179&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) will snugly fit an iPad Air 13-inch with easy access to all the ports and buttons. This shockproof case is made from flexible hybrid leather that is not only durable but also luxurious to the touch. Additionally, the leather is scratch-resistant and easy to wipe clean.

 In addition to the leather front cover, the case sports a flexible yet durable TPU frame and a TPU/polycarbonate bottom for impact resistance. The corners are also protected, giving your iPad Air 13-inch tablet full-body protection and giving you peace of mind.

 The stand cover features two grooves, allowing you to place your iPad at 45 or 60-degree angles. It also has a 360-degree rotating buckle that you can use to perfect the viewpoint.

| Designed for iPad Air 13-inch |           |
| Durable yet soft to the touch |           |

 Otterbox says it has designed the [Statement Series Studio](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRH92ZM/A/otterbox-statement-series-studio-case-for-ipad-air-13-inch-m2-blue) for the working professional. It offers the style and durability required by on-the-go types and is the first Statement Series Studio case developed specifically for the iPad Air. So, fear not; it’s a protective case that fits the 13-inch model like a glove.

 It’s functional, lightweight, elegantly slim, and provides impressive protection. Combining hard plastic, synthetic materials, and TPU ensures durability and offers rigid protection against drops, bumps, and scrapes. The synthetic materials contribute to the overall strength and flexibility of the case, while the TPU provides a shock-absorbent layer for extra impact resistance. If you drop your tablet when it’s in this case, it simply rebounds with no harm done.

 A soft yet resilient fabric disguises the case’s rugged build with an elegant finish. It comes in two minimalist yet sophisticated colors for the busy professional: blue and dark gray. While commuting, it will match your professional attire, and if the front part of the cover is in your way while you take notes, you can detach it. There's also a secure slot along the top for discreetly storing and charging your Apple Pencil Pro once you've finished taking notes.

 The case sports an adjustable stand that you can modify to whatever angle you need. Whether you are taking notes, on a video call, reading, browsing the web, or typing, you can quickly fix it to the most comfortable angle.

| Designed for iPad Air 13-inch          | Still fairly pricey |
| Endorsed by Apple                      |                     |

| Less expensive than the Magic Keyboard |                     |

 A protective case with a detachable keyboard is one of the most versatile options when seeking a safeguarding shell for your new iPad Air. The [Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard Case](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRH22ZM/A/logitech-combo-touch-keyboard-case-for-ipad-air-13-inch-m2) is designed to fit and work harmoniously with the 13-inch iPad Air. While there is an argument for sticking with Apple and the [Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJQL3LL/A/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-air-13-inch-m2-us-english-white), the Logitech design is seamless and available at a better price.

 The protective case offers peace of mind, while the flexible kickstand and full-size keyboard allow you to use it for just about any iPad activity. It’s a sturdy and reliable yet portable case. It’s Logitech’s thinnest and lightest Combo Touch yet and easily slips into a backpack or briefcase. It’s ideal for students, travelers, and business professionals who prefer lightweight, multi-functional accessories.

 The trackpad also deserves a superlative as it is the biggest ever made for any Combo Touch. You can use all the familiar swipes, pinches, and double-taps precisely, while the spring scissor keys are large and comfortable to type on.

 Thanks to the keyboard's adjustable backlights, you can work at night or in dimmed offices. When you’re finished typing, you can easily detach it to draw or read. You can also adjust the kickstand and find the perfect angle to watch TV or video chat. There’s also a secure slot for storing and charging your Apple Pencil Pro.

 This model of the [ESR Rebound Hybrid Case 360](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CRHGSCTL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003179&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is designed only for the 13-inch iPad Air and is one of the more durable options you’ll find. The detachable magnetic cover has stronger-than-usual magnets, making it easier to attach it securely to the shock-resistant transparent back. This gives your iPad Air full-body protection against mishaps, and once you throw in the shock-absorbing sides and corners, you have total 360-degree protection.

 You can fold the case into a stable stand and use it in various modes. The cover acts as a base when in landscape or portrait mode. And, thanks to its strong friction properties, you can easily adjust your iPad Air to various positions without it slipping. Alternatively, you can achieve a fixed position using the tri-fold stand, even folding it down to a ‘pillow-like’ form with a slight angle for sketching or writing. The cover is also fully detachable so that it doesn’t interfere with your activities when holding the tablet.

 The ESR Rebound Hybrid Case 360 has a space on the side for magnetic charging of the Apple Pencil Pro with a clasp to keep the Pencil in place. It’s available in six stylish colors and shades, including black, white, gray, navy blue, purple, and pink.

| Shock-absorbing corners           |                           |

 If you prefer the transparent look, the [ESR for iPad Air 13-inch Case](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CRHKL8DG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003179&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers just that. However, you should note that this case only provides back protection, and the product's price reflects this. It’s affordable if you just want simple protection while maintaining the iPad Air aesthetic.

 It’s lightweight, ultra-thin, and snugly fits a 13-inch iPad Air. However, don’t let its ultra-slim profile fool you. It features a flexible polymer frame and a scratch-resistant acrylic back with a camera guard to protect the all-important lens. In addition, it features shock-absorbing Air Guard corners, essential for when any clumsy drops occur.

 Moreover, the acrylic is yellowing-resistant, unlike other plastics that can quickly look like it has spent an age in a smokey room. The case will remain clear and ensure your iPad Air looks as new as the day you bought it for a longer period. As a bonus, you get magnetic charging for the Apple Pencil Pro.

 Apple typically promotes the more durable and affordable entry-level iPad as a more suitable tablet for children. However, the iPad Air can be a great choice for older kids and teenagers. It’s a good pick for educational purposes, creative projects, and, of course, entertainment. And those older kids and teenagers will love the wide choice of colorful and trendy designs the [May Chen Case](https://amazon.com/dp/B0BM3PJR8B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003179&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) provides. From Cute Lion and Cute Owl to Space Galaxy, there’s a design for even the fussiest teenagers among the 37 choices.

 The case is covered front and back with scratch-resistant polyurethane leather. It’s tough and easy to wipe clean. The grip is also good, but it has a luxurious, soft feel, and the beautiful designs are the frosting on the cake. Under the PU leather is impact-resistant TPU plastic. This plastic also covers and fortifies the corners, protecting your iPad Air.

 You can set the case in two positions. The 65-degree angle is ideal for watching movies or video chatting, or you can lay it down at a 30-degree angle for sketching, drawing, and note-taking. There’s also a slot to hold and charge the Apple Pencil Pro. It clasps the stylus in place and features a small notch that allows you to easily poke the Pencil back out.

## FAQ

### Can I use my old iPad Air case with the new Air model?

 If you have bought a 13-inch iPad Air, then no, you can’t. This model is the first 13-inch iPad Air. The largest size of previous generations is just 10.9 inches. However, if you have bought a new [6th-generation 11-inch iPad Air](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D3J617D7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003179&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), it will fit any old case you have for 4th- and 5th-generation 11-inch models because the dimensions are exactly the same.

### What is the difference between the 11-inch iPad Air and the 13-inch iPad Air?

 The only difference between the two is the size. The 11-inch model offers better portability, while the 13-inch model provides more room for viewing.

### What is the difference between the 13-inch iPad Air and the 13-inch iPad Pro?

 The most significant difference is the iPad Pro’s M4 chip. This chip hasn’t even made it to the MacBook yet, so it is a major feature. However, this also means the [13-inch iPad Pro](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D3JB95VD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003179&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is considerably more expensive. But, on top of the extra power, the Pro also offers an Ultra Retina XDR display for a more immersive visual experience and [ProMotion Technology](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premier-software-for-photo-based-videography/). The latter is Apple’s way of saying the display has a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and gameplay.

 There are [other differences](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/must-haves-best-android-picture-adjusters/) favoring the 13-inch iPad Pro, including better audio and a slightly better camera.

### Do I need the Apple Pencil Pro for my iPad Air?

 The newest iPad Air only supports Apple Pencil Pro or Apple Pencil (USB-C). This means if you have an older Apple Pencil, it will not work on the iPad Air 13-inch.

### How do I pair my Apple AirPods with my iPad Air?

 Pairing your AirPods with your iPad Air is simple. On the iPad Air, go to Settings, then Bluetooth and toggle Bluetooth to the on position. Then go back to the Home Screen. Following this, open the case with your AirPods inside and hold it next to your iPad Air (If you have AirPods Max, take them out of the Smart Case). Then, simply follow the onscreen instructions and tap Done.
