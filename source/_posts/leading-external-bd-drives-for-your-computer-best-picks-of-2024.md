## Steering Through Words - Best Vehicle Reviews of 2024

 The best car code readers are a simple way to pinpoint issues with your car before you shell out some serious cash for a mechanic.

 While they can't fix your car's mechanical problems, they can tell you where to begin. These tools are a must-have for anyone looking to purchase a second-hand vehicle, allowing you to quickly reveal any glaring inadequacies the previous owner may have failed to mention.

 Pros

* Easy-to-use keypad
* Compact design
* No battery required

 Cons

* Low reader accuracy
* Some compatibility issues

 The Ancel Classic OBD Scanner is easy to use, even for those uncomfortable working on cars. It works on most cars made in the U.S. after 1996 or in the EU or Asia after 2000 and supports multiple languages, including English, French, Spanish, Russian, and German. The large LCD has a white backlight to make it easy to read even in dim lighting.

 If it turns out that your code isn’t serious, this device can turn off that annoying check engine light. The scanner comes with a 2.5-foot long, well-insulated cable that connects with your car’s OBDII data link connector; no other battery or charger is required as it powers up through that link. A three-year warranty means you can rest easy choosing this scanner.

 Pros

* Works through a user-friendly app
* Durable
* Always stays plugged in

 Cons

* Bluetooth connection can be a bit spotty
* Pricey

 The BlueDriver OBDII Scanner isn’t the cheapest option out there, but seeing as it’s aimed at those who want more professional readings than you can get from all-in-one units, that’s to be expected. This tiny sensor, once installed, transmits codes, errors, and information via Bluetooth to the BlueDriver app. This app is the centerpiece of the whole unit, as it’s one of the most beautifully designed and full-featured pieces of software we’ve seen. You can call up codes, search them, and even set the app into HUD mode to treat it as an onboard meter.

 What’s extra interesting about this is the 24/7 support, meaning you can contact an actual human if you need more information on a particular reading. You can even have the app generate on-demand repair reports compiled and verified by certified technicians. These repair reports are pulled from a database of over 6.6 million vehicle-specific diagnostics, so chances are, you can pull one up for your specific vehicle.

### Codes and Sensor Readings

 What kind of codes—manufacturer, generic, etc.—and vehicle sensor readings do you need your reader to be able to interpret? Make sure you choose a model that's compatible with your particular car.

 FAQ

* Do code readers work on all cars?  
 OBD2[car code readers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-car-code-reader-534869) will work on all cars with onboard diagnostic software. OBD2 is a universal interface in most cars introduced in the 1980s. While it won't work on every old car out there, you should be covered as long as it is somewhat new. Almost all newer cars will support it.
* Are car code readers worth it?  
 Car code readers are relatively inexpensive, making them a worthwhile investment if you want to pinpoint an issue with your vehicle without taking it to an expensive mechanic. A car code reader lets you read and clear codes, view basic parameter IDs, and check and reset readiness monitors. This gives you an excellent way to tell if the problem is something you can fix quickly before shelling out to a car shop, potentially saving you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars.
