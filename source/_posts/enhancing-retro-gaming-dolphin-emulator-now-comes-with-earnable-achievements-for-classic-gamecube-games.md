## Enhancing Retro Gaming: Dolphin Emulator Now Comes with Earnable Achievements for Classic GameCube Games

A big turning point in games was in the late 2000s and early 2010s, when most people were introduced to the concept of achievements or trophies: games would reward you for completing certain milestones or doing certain tasks. That was never available for the Nintendo GameCube, but the Dolphin emulator is changing that.

 Dolphin has just announced that it's adding integration with RetroAchievements, a service that provides sets of achievements for some of the older titles you play. Now, if you download the latest version of the Dolphin emulator and you make an account on RetroAchievements, you will get access to achievements for a grand total of 100 GameCube games. Each achievement has a set amounts of points assigned, with a higher number depending on how difficult it is to obtain.

 Achievements are available for popular titles such as _Super Mario Sunshine_ and _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_, and they can give you a brand-new way to play a game. At the moment, achievements are only available for GameCube titles, but we also want to see them for Nintendo Wii games down the road. The Dolphin team says that work on that is eventually due to start down the road, and frankly, it's something I've always wanted to see—the Wii competed against the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, which were some of the first consoles to popularize the concept of achievements, while the Wii was the major holdout. Dolphin and RetroAchievements have the chance to right this historical wrong.

 RetroAchievements integration is available in Dolphin version 2407-64 or later—in case you missed it, [Dolphin has a new versioning system](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-7-ways-to-unlock-a-locked-oppo-f25-pro-5g-phone-by-drfone-android/). You can [download Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/download/) from the official website, and the [Android version](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004172/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dolphinemu.dolphinemu&hl=en%5FUS) is available in the Google Play Store. Again, this is just limited to select GameCube games for now.
