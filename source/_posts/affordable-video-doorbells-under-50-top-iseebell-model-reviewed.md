 _We purchased the Urban Armor Gear MacBook Pro 13-inch Laptop Case so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review._

 When you’re spending over a thousand dollars on a[MacBook Pro computer](https://www.lifewire.com/reformat-macbook-pro-4587318) , you’ll likely want to invest in (spend more than the average $20 to $25 on) a case that keeps your device safe, particularly if you’re accident-prone.

 You’ll also likely want to find an option that has an extremely snug fit and a good grip, and that is overall thoughtfully designed with layers of protection. That option could be Under Armor Gear’s MacBook Pro 13-inch Laptop Case, a strategically-designed case that can withstand a drop.

## **Design: Rugged looks**

 The UAG MacBook Pro 13-inch Laptop Case blows the competition out of the water in terms of sturdiness. When you look at this product, you see a thick, rubber-and-plastic frame that actually stands a chance of saving your delicate[MacBook](https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650) from a drop. A lot of budget cases feel cheap and flimsy both on and off of the laptop, but the UAG Laptop Case is more substantial.

 The one-piece design and thick shell are billed to help shield from dents and scratches. The robust rubber padding along the edges of the case also helps to absorb impact from bumps and drops, protecting the frame of the laptop in its entirety. Along the spine of the computer, you’ll find a patch of rubber with a particularly tactile grip, which helps to prevent your laptop from falling out of your hands, even in damp conditions.

 The style of the case is naturally more utilitarian than it is sleek.

 With the case on, all ports are easily accessible. The snap closure is so secure that you need not worry about your laptop opening in transit or in your bag. But this snap closure can make it difficult to open again later (so much so that I was afraid I’d chip one of my freshly-painted nails when I tried).

 The case fits tightly onto the laptop, which helps to keep the computer safe overall but also makes it difficult to remove. Of course, if you don’t plan to take your MacBook out of the case often and maximum protection is a priority, then this probably isn’t a dealbreaker.

 The style of the case is naturally more utilitarian than it is sleek, but that’s usually the tradeoff for something that offers such protection. And despite the extra protection, there seems to be a sufficient amount of ventilation on the bottom of the case.

## **Setup Process: A one-time deal**

 On the UAG website, you’ll find a YouTube video designed to guide users through the installation of the case. You should watch it before installing it yourself in order to avoid scratching or otherwise damaging your MacBook Pro.

 Getting the case off is much harder than getting it on the computer.

 Beware of the fact that getting the case off is much harder than getting it on the computer. This product is for those who are sure they want something with this kind of protection and who love the rugged design, and for those who aren’t inclined to take the case off regularly.

## **Performance: Tough and reliable**

 Once you’ve installed the UAG MacBook Pro 13-inch[Laptop Case](https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cases-and-sleeves-to-buy-4074109) , the case is, by all appearances, impervious and impact-resistant. The sturdy appearance is backed by a military drop test rating (the case is advertised to have endured 25 drops from 4 feet high with no damage). The extra protection neither compromises the ventilation nor access to the ports.

 The only hassle we encountered when testing usability was the snap closure, which is great for keeping your laptop shut in transit but difficult to pry open when trying to use your computer.

## **Durability: As tough as it gets**

 We found the UAG MacBook Pro 13-inch Laptop Case to be as resilient as it could be. We dropped the case from standing height on a variety of surfaces—on those as soft as carpet and as hard as hardwood and concrete—and it sustained virtually no damage (a few superficial scratches at most).

 The findings give us reason to believe that your MacBook would be pretty well-protected in this laptop case in the event that you accidentally dropped it.

 We dropped the case from standing height on a variety of surfaces … and it sustained virtually no damage (a few superficial scratches at most).

## **Price: A small sum to pay to protect such expensive hardware**

 The Urban Armor Gear MacBook Pro 13-Inch Laptop Case retails for $79.95, which is definitely on the more expensive end of the spectrum for a laptop case. But if you are taking your laptop into rugged conditions or you’re simply accident-prone, we think $80 seems a fair amount to pay to keep your far-more-pricey MacBook safe.

## **Competition: Lacks in quality of materials used and overall sturdiness**

 There aren’t many laptop covers that offer the protection of this case. Amazon has some other offerings that advertise heavy duty protection from manufacturers like i-BLASON and iBenzer at a fraction of the cost of this product, but UAG seems to be the only case that is supported by a military drop test rating.

 Compared to others we’ve reviewed, this case also stacks up pretty favorably. The thoughtful design, quality materials, and performance give it an edge, especially for those seeking the highest level of protection for their device.

 Check out our other reviews of the best MacBook Pro cases on the market today.

 Final Verdict

 **More durable than we could have imagined and well worth the steep price point.**

 The Under Armor Gear (UAG) MacBook Pro 13-inch Laptop Case is an excellent option for those seeking maximum protection. This case may not be for you if you’ll need to remove and reinstall it regularly, which is both a hassle and a potential risk for damage.
