##  What to Look for in an HDMI Splitter

 When you’re searching for an HDMI splitter, there are only a few important aspects to consider. Think about the number of output displays you want to send your input signal to, your desired resolution and refresh rate, and the distance between your splitter and displays.

 The most common HDMI splitter features one input port and four output ports, meaning you could take the signal from your streaming stick, for example, and send it to up to four different TVs. You can find some splitters that only output to two displays, while other splitters can send a signal to eight or 16 displays.

 For people looking to duplicate a video signal or a static image, [4K resolution](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-oppo-a78-5g-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/) at 30Hz will be plenty. However, the best bet for most people will be an HDMI splitter capable of supporting a 4K resolution at 60Hz. If you want to future-proof your setup, you can splurge on an HDMI splitter that supports 4K@120Hz, or even 8K@60Hz.

 Most HDMI splitters offer a decent transmission distance that’ll cover the span of an average house, so if you forget to double-check this spec before buying, it won’t be the end of the world. However, if you know you need to send a signal to your TV upstairs on one side of the house and your HDMI splitter is downstairs on the other side, you’ll want to make sure the splitter and your HDMI cable are both rated to transmit the signal that far.

 If you have features on your TV or computer monitor that you want to utilize, make sure the HDMI splitter you choose also supports those features. A few popular features to look out for are HDR compatibility and surround sound support like Dolby Atmos.

 For anyone with displays that support a different max resolution and refresh rate, you’ll want to find an HDMI splitter that supports downscaling. This feature allows your 4K@60Hz display to stay at that max resolution while the signal is downgraded for your 1080p@60Hz display.

 Because the terms [‘HDMI switch’ and ‘HDMI splitter’](https://howto.techidaily.com/full-guide-how-to-fix-connection-is-not-private-on-samsung-galaxy-a05s-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) are often confused with one another, it’s important to note the distinction here to ensure you’re searching for the right device. An HDMI splitter takes a single input and sends it to multiple outputs, while an HDMI switch does the opposite. If you need to send multiple inputs to a single output, you need an HDMI switch. If you want something that can send multiple inputs to multiple outputs, search for an HDMI matrix.

 This [4K 1x4 HDMI splitter from OREI](https://www.amazon.com/Orei-HDMI-Splitter-Duplicater-OREI/dp/B0891WY8SF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-splitters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the best option for most people. The ‘1x4’ part of its title indicates that it has one HDMI 2.0 input port and four HDMI 2.0 output ports. You can use this splitter to take the signal from a single input device, like a streaming stick or a Blu-ray player, and send it to four different displays throughout your home.

 All the HDMI ports on this splitter support a 4K resolution at 60Hz, and it’s compatible with all [HDMI devices](https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/mastering-final-cut-the-ultimate-guide/). OREI’s 4K splitter is also equipped with support for Dolby-AC3, HDCP 2.2, and Dolby TrueHD/DTS-HD master audio. It’s a compact device, measuring 5.9 x 2.4 x 0.8 inches, and can transmit a signal up to 200 feet away with fiber optic active HDMI cables.

 Plus, this OREI splitter supports downscaling, which allows all your devices to stay at their maximum resolution, unlike some splitters that only recognize the lowest resolution of all connected displays and use that as the standard. With the OREI splitter, if you have a 4K display and three 1080p displays, it’ll keep the 4K resolution on your first display and automatically scale the video down to 1080p resolution on the others.

 For less than $20, this [Keliiyo 1x4 HDMI splitter](https://www.amazon.com/Splitter-Keliiyo-Powered-Converter-Resolutions/dp/B076JDXPRG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-splitters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers one HDMI 1.4 input and four total outputs. With HDMI 1.4 technology, the max possible resolution and refresh rate will be 4K@30Hz, or 1080p@60Hz. If you only plan to output video or a static image, the lower refresh rate won’t be much of an issue, and you’ll still get a sharp 4K resolution.

 This HDMI splitter is incredibly compact, with dimensions of 3.8 x 2.4 x 0.9 inches, and the body is made of an anti-interference, anti-corrosion metal material. From your input device to all your output displays, Keliiyo’s budget-friendly HDMI splitter supports a transmission distance of up to 100 feet.

 If a 4K@30Hz signal is plenty for you, the only potential downside of this HDMI splitter is that it doesn’t support downscaling. This means that if you have one display that only supports 1080p@60Hz, and the others support 4K@30Hz, the signal to all your displays will be the lower resolution because the device isn’t capable of splitting unique resolution and refresh rate combos. Keliiyo recommends setting all your devices to the same resolution prior to use for the best results.

| Pros                                               | Cons                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Smooth 4K resolution at 120Hz for two HDMI outputs | A pricey investment compared to 4K@60Hz options |
| Future-proof 8K resolution support                 | Doesn’t support downscaling or Sonos-ARC/e-ARC  |
| Supports HDCP 2.3, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision        |                                                 |

 OREI is one of the most reliable brands for HDMI splitters, and this [8K 1x2 splitter](https://www.amazon.com/OREI-Splitter-Duplicate-Extractor-BK-104A/dp/B0BHL8LF1W?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-splitters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) will future-proof your setup for quite a few years. It’s a pricey investment, but it’ll allow you to send a 4K@120Hz signal from one input device to two different devices via HDMI 2.1 ports, as long as all of your devices support that resolution and refresh rate.

 Alternatively, this OREI HDMI splitter is also capable of sending an 8K@60Hz signal, but it doesn’t support downscaling. This means all of your output displays need to support 8K@60Hz if you want to utilize this high resolution and refresh rate combo. If one of your output displays (or your input device) only supports 4K@60Hz, the signal sent to both displays will be the lower 4K@60Hz option.

 OREI’s 8K splitter doesn’t support Sonos-ARC/e-ARC technology, but it does support HDCP 2.3, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, and audio extraction via optical and analog audio outputs, so you can complete your media setup with a soundbar or speakers. At 5.7 x 2.7 x 1 inches, it’s a long HDMI splitter but pretty inconspicuous on a TV stand. If you need more outputs that support a high-res signal, check out [OREI’s 8K 1x4 splitter](https://www.amazon.com/OREI-Splitter-Duplicate-Extractor-BK-104A/dp/B0C5G92Z6Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-splitters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) instead.

| Pros                                   | Cons                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 4K@60Hz HDMI 2.0 output signal         | Some users report issues with 4K and downscaling |
| Supports up to eight total displays    |                                                  |
| Supports EDID settings and downscaling |                                                  |

 The most common setup for HDMI splitters is 1x4, which means there’s space for one input and four outputs. This [HDMI splitter from J-Tech Digital](https://www.amazon.com/J-Tech-Digital-JTD4KSP0108-Splitter-Resolutions/dp/B00ZPWEKCW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-splitters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) can send a 4K@60Hz signal from a single HDMI 2.0 input to up to eight different displays. It measures 10.5 x 4.8 x 1.1 inches, and you’ll find all the HDMI ports lined up in the back with convenient indicator lights on the front that correspond with each port.

 Although some homeowners may find a 1x8 splitter necessary, this HDMI splitter will probably find its best use in a classroom or a business needing to display the same video or image to multiple screens at once. There are a few easy [EDID settings](https://www.extron.com/article/uedid) to swap between quickly, like a default 1080p output or 4Kx2K output for all devices.

 When using this splitter with any non-computer device and multiple displays, it’s only possible to mirror the same video or image coming from the input device. One [J-Tech Digital support team member](https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx1OK9UI973JGNC/ref=ask%5Fdp%5Flsw%5Fal%5Fhza?asin=B00ZPWEKCW&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-splitters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) notes that if you’re using the splitter with a computer, you can use it to extend your display, but the consensus among [most users](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19HACPSRAS8MA?ref=pf%5Fvv%5Fat%5Fpdctrvw%5Fsrp&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-splitters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [another J-Tech Digital support team member](https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx1BE71FSOFKMSB/ref=ask%5Fdp%5Flsw%5Fal%5Fhza?asin=B00ZPWEKCW&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-splitters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is that it can only duplicate your single input.

 This 1x8 HDMI splitter does support downscaling, but [some users](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LF53O3Q0W5WP?ref=pf%5Fvv%5Fat%5Fpdctrvw%5Fsrp&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-splitters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) note that it’s finicky at times. If you have one display that supports 4K resolution and other displays that only support 1080p, this HDMI splitter is capable of sending a 4K signal to the 4K display and a 1080p signal to the 1080p displays. HDMI splitters that don’t support downscaling would send a 1080p picture to all your displays, regardless of whether one was capable of 4K.

| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Five HDMI 2.0 inputs (4K@60Hz supported)   | Not suitable for those needing multiple outputs for one input |
| Can switch manually or via included remote |                                                               |
| Supports auto switching                    |                                                               |

 If you’ve skimmed this list and realized you need a device with multiple inputs for a single output, the device you’re looking for is called an HDMI switch. The [best HDMI switch](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-staying-within-the-limits-key-youtube-policies/) for most people is [SGEYR’s 5x1 switch](https://www.amazon.com/SGEYR-Selector-Switcher-Compatible-Projector/dp/B07MCS9PJD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-splitters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) because it offers more than enough input ports for the average household.

 This HDMI switch offers five HDMI 2.0 inputs and a single HDMI 2.0 output, all capable of supporting a 4K@60Hz signal, perfect for most games and streaming media. Switching between all your input devices is a breeze, whether you want to switch manually with a button on the HDMI switch itself, from your couch with the included remote, or via auto-switching.

 Not all input devices support auto switching by default, though, like the Apple TV, Xbox One, PS5, and Roku. If your input device supports this feature, the SGEYR switch can automatically detect when that device turns on, switch to that specific input immediately, and often turn your TV on as well.

 SGEYR’s HDMI switch will barely take up space on your TV stand, measuring 5.8 x 2.4 x 0.8 inches, and its durable metal body and 24K gold-plated HDMI connectors will extend its overall life. A few [Amazon reviews](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28BH0MATTU45O?ref=pf%5Fvv%5Fat%5Fpdctrvw%5Fsrp&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-splitters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) between 2020 and early 2022 mention that this HDMI switch didn’t come with a power adapter, but recent reviews make no similar complaints, and the Amazon listing says it comes with a DC 5V power adapter.

### What's the difference between an HDMI switch and an HDMI splitter?

 An HDMI switch takes multiple inputs (devices) and displays them on a single output (screen), whereas an HDMI splitter takes a single input and displays it to multiple outputs. An HDMI Matrix is a combination of both.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### When should I use an HDMI splitter?

 An HDMI splitter can be useful to business owners, teachers, or homeowners who want to duplicate a single input on multiple displays. Someone might use an HDMI splitter to watch the game on multiple TVs throughout the home or display their restaurant’s menu on multiple screens.

### Will using an HDMI splitter reduce image quality?

 Because HDMI is a digital signal, splitting it won’t reduce image quality. However, if you get an HDMI splitter that supports 1080p and you have a 4K TV, you’ll notice a decrease in image quality because the HDMI splitter isn’t capable of producing anything higher than 1080p.
