 _X-Chair provided us with a review unit for one of our writers to test. Read on for the full review._

 Getting a[home office setup](https://www.lifewire.com/the-best-home-office-setups-5096922) that helps ensure a comfortable work from home environment can be a tricky beast. From finding the right desk for your needs to grabbing the[best ergonomic keyboards](https://www.lifewire.com/best-keyboards-4136226) , one can almost forget one of the most important features in building a home office: a quality office chair.

 Admittedly, this was one of my biggest follies as I began to work from home. I naively believed that just grabbing a dining room chair was the most reasonable option. Thankfully, the X4 chair by X-Chair came into my life. With leather cushioned seats and lumbar support, I was enamored with this office chair.

## Design: Fancy looks

 The X4 Executive Chair comes in up to eight different colors, with each color offering a different option—and a varying price tag. I chose the model with a red premium leather finish. For an executive office chair, the bright red leather gave it a fun pop of color that complimented my standing desk. At 54 x 25 x 21.5 inches (LWD), the chair offers a variety of customization options, including a headrest and higher-quality wheels.

 While the frame is made of metal, the armrests appear to be made of soft-touch polycarbonate with a slight slope for a comfortable feel. The armrests’ build material didn’t quite fit the quality of the rest of the chair, however, they’re likely going get dinged the most by the desk, so it makes sense since polycarbonate is durable and withstands bumps well. And, either way, the chair still looks very sleek and stylish for any office setup.

## Comfort: It’s all in the ergonomics

 The X4 hypes up all of its ergonomic settings. In fact, it boasts that it’s completely adjustable, from the comfort of its lumbar support to the height and angle of the headrest. At first, I struggled to get some of the pieces to shift, particularly the aforementioned headrest. It took me and one other person five minutes to get it to budge an inch. This did not particularly fill me with hope as I set about adjusting the rest of the chair.

 Despite the first issue with the headrest, every other part of the chair adjusts easily, from the four-dimensional armrests to the backrest—and in most cases with the press of a lever.

 However, my fears proved to be unfounded. Despite the first issue with the headrest, every other part of the chair adjusts easily, from the four-dimensional armrests to the backrest—and in most cases with the press of a lever. That said, the chair takes time to adjust properly and it may take a few different tries to find angles that work for you.

## Performance and Usage: Amazing experience

 When you find that sweet spot for this chair, holy moly. Most of my day, I’m hunched over[laptops](https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650) for work. The X4 makes sure that you don’t slouch, and are kept in a comfortable position. In the entire week of testing this chair, my body seemed less irked when I would stand up to stretch.

 My only gripe during testing was that I didn’t spring for the locked wheels. When I would stand up, my X4 would try to go along with me for the ride. More than once I had to stop it from ramming into the other office furniture in my workspace.

 X-Chair offers a plethora of wheel options, and instead of going with the complimentary wheels, I opted for the clear blade wheels. They’re smooth and nearly silent on my hardwood oak floors. However, it’s better to be safe than sorry, and get the locking wheels if you want your office chair to stay in your office.

 In the entire week of testing this chair, my body seemed less irked when I would stand up to stretch.

 One of the largest features of this chair is “SciFloat Infinite Recline”, allowing you to recline and keep working throughout the day. It’s an easy way to adjust your back if you’re stuck at the desk all day. In my testing, it was nice to have this feature since I could unlock the back of the chair and relax when my back ached. At first, I preferred my chair to be locked into place. By the end of the week, I was leaving the lock off and leaning back.

## Price: It’ll cost you

 With all of the extra features, it came as no surprise to me that the X4 chair runs from around $1,249 on up. I personally gaped at that price tag.

 Rather than view it as a major hit to your savings account, it’s better to view it as an investment in your comfort.

 But, with work from home becoming more common, it makes sense to build up a space that will truly work for you. Rather than view it as a major hit to your savings account, it’s better to view it as an investment in your comfort.

## X4 Executive Chair vs. Mavix M9 Gaming Chair

 The X4 chair is the latest model in a series of executive office chairs by X-Chair. The other models of this chair, the X1, X2, and X3 are only differentiated by the fabric used in them, and whether or not they use mesh.

 However, the X4 isn’t the sole desk chair that X-Chair offers. There’s some brand differentiation, but the company also has the Mavix M9 Gaming Chair, which is their chair geared toward gamers and streamers. To be frank, these chairs are extremely similar. They both offer similar adjustability, from the backrests to the headrests. However, it’s the details that set them apart. For example, the X4 chair comes with a plethora of wheel options, from the complimentary wheels to the blade wheels. The Mavix M9 chair comes only with one set of wheels that have a locking feature already built into them, so in terms of customization, the Mavix M9 doesn’t have so many options.

 That said, the Mavix M9 is must cheaper, starting at around $999 for one of these chairs that offers a similar Dynamic Variable Lumbar support for long hours in front of a computer. However, the lower cost also means you get standard plush foam seats rather than more premium leather unless you decide to upgrade.

 Realistically, you can’t go wrong with either chair. If you prefer slightly more adjustability options, or even a fancier finish, then the X4 Chair is the best option for your needs. If you’re comfortable with mesh seating and don’t need all the bells and whistles, then the Mavix M9 chair would be the better option for you.

 Final Verdict

**A great office chair for a premium price.**

 Sometimes, a large splurge is worthwhile. When it comes to the X4 Executive Chair, the adjustability combined with the SciFloat technology makes it a great, comfortable, and stylish chair for any office.
