### Proactive Networking

 LinkedIn Premium isn't necessary if you are not interested in deep networking for business or recruitment.

### Cost

 The cost can be prohibitive, especially for those who are starting their careers. The Basic (free) plan allows you to connect with others and build your network while giving and receiving recommendations.

### Job Insights

 You don't need a LinkedIn Premium subscription if you don't need access to competitive intelligence about a job or a company. You can still search for jobs and use alternative search tools to gather market intelligence.

### InMail Messages

 You may not need to message people outside your immediate network as there are other ways to contact them.

### Recruitment

 You don't need a subscription if your company is using another recruitment tool.

### Professional Development

 LinkedIn Learning courses are helpful, but many other online learning courses can be accessed for free or at a lower cost.

## Are LinkedIn Premium Benefits Worth It?

 LinkedIn Premium is a worthy investment for your career or business if you have the budget.

 But remember, the decision to pay for a LinkedIn Premium subscription or go with the free LinkedIn Basic lies in the level of access you want to your professional network.

 LinkedIn Premium isn't cheap, and you must balance your needs with the features you want to take advantage of. For instance, a subscription can be a good investment for recruiters and entrepreneurs. It may not be one for someone on the cusp of a career. Before you decide, score the features with an estimate of how and how much you will put them to use for specific scenarios.
