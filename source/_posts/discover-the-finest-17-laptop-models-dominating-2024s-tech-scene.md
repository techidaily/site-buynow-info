## Discover the Elite Body Cams Dominating 2Amoy Market This Year

While body cameras have become more commonplace among law enforcement, plenty of good options are available for the civilian market.

 Many states and cities have laws allowing body camera footage to be admissible in court, making them popular among anyone needing to document their version of events.

 Body cameras can also be used for generic recording and live streaming.

 Pros

* Robust design
* 5MP CMOS sensor
* 16x digital zoom
* Motion detection feature

 Cons

* Not optimized for police and security guards

 With a robust design, powerful audio-visual data recording capabilities, and many other features, MIUFLY 1296P is the best body-worn camera. Equipped with a 5MP[CMOS sensor](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-cmos-2625826) , MIUFLY allows high video capture in a variety of resolutions, ranging from 848 x 480p (30/60fps) to 2304 x 1296p (30fps).

 The camera lens has a 140-degree viewing angle and up to 16x digital zoom. Videos are encoded using the H.264 compression standard and saved in MP4 format.

 The camera utilizes its integrated microphone to record audio in WAV format and can even capture photos while recording video. MIUFLY 1296P can embed useful information like User ID, Time & Date stamp, and GPS coordinates (as a watermark) into recorded videos.

 Thanks to a motion-detection feature, the wearable camera can automatically start video capture on detecting activity. A two-inch (240 x 320 pixels resolution) LCD lets you view captured videos, and you can set a password to prevent recorded data from being stolen/deleted.

 The device has four infrared LEDs for capturing videos in dark environments. MIUFLY 1296P comes with a 2,900mAh rechargeable battery, allowing up to 10 hours of footage to be captured in one go.

 Pros

* Sharp photos and video
* Easy to use in action settings
* Wi-Fi control through the mobile app

 Cons

* Questions about long-term durability
* Hot USB ports after prolonged use

 The body cam category is similar to the more general action cam category. Both buyers want good performance no matter what activity they're participating in — whether for safety or just for documenting a hike.

 Of the budget action body cams that exist, the AKASO EK7000 is one of the most affordable, and best of all, it doesn't require you to sacrifice a whole lot of functionality in the process.

 At 4K, for instance, it can shoot video at 25fps and up to 30fps at 2.7K (still a formidable resolution). These numbers are leaps and bounds ahead of hyper-specific body cams.

Lifewire / Scott Gercken

 The EK7000 also has electronic image stabilization built-in, and it can still shoot while submerged up to 131 feet underwater, meaning it doesn't have to be relegated to landscapes.

 However, one drawback for body cam users is its roughly 90-minute footage cap. Anything over that, and you'll be reaching for the charger. But because it only weighs about two ounces, it has many accessories in the box.

 And when you consider its Wi-Fi streaming and sharing integrations, it turns out to be a leading contender for the title of best body cam.

 Pros

* Durable
* 1080p video recording
* 21x optical zoom
* Long-lasting battery

 Cons

* Some quality control issues

 The Rexing P1 is a durable body camera ideal for law enforcement. It boasts a 1080p FHD camera and 21x optical zoom that supports night vision capabilities. It can capture crisp footage up to 50 feet in the way, even in dark conditions. It has 64GB of built-in storage for recording video, photos, and audio.

 Battery life is solid, with a 3,000mAh battery that should allow 10 hours of video recording, more than 11 hours of audio, or 20 hours of standby time. It should let you use the camera for the average workday without recharging.

 Other features include password protection, which encrypts files so they can't be stolen or deleted. The only way to delete files is by connecting through a computer with a USB cable.

 Perhaps the most significant selling point is the IP67 waterproof rating, meaning the camera can survive complete submersion underwater. It's also shock-resistant to withstand drops, bumps, and scrapes.

## What to Look For in Body Cams

 The best body cam should have a durable, compact design, good video resolution, and long battery life, so it doesn't need to be frequently recharged. Since body cameras are commonly used by outdoor adventurers, sports enthusiasts, and law enforcement, durability and a waterproof and shock resistance rating are essential to consider.

### Resolution & Video Quality

 The key things you'll want to have in a body cam are a resolution and video quality that's crisp and smooth. The most standard resolution is 1080p at 30fps, which should give you smooth recording without breaking the budget. You can step up to 60fps if you want smoother recording (or slow down to 24fps for slow-motion effects). Above that, you get 4K, usually at 30fps, which is much sharper, resulting in a corresponding price increase.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Durability & Waterproofing

 As with anything that gets worn and carried around with you all the time, durability is hugely important for a body cam. If you're in law enforcement, you'll want MIL-STD 810G, a certification that promises lab-tested shock resistance, drop resistance, and more. A waterproof rating is also essential, with IP65 meaning the device is protected against submersion in water up to 5m and also resistant to dust. There are higher and lower IP ratings, with IPX ratings meaning no dust resistance and just water.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Battery Life

 If you wear it all day, a body cam can't be easily recharged, so battery life is essential. The size of the built-in cell can vary, with 1,000mAh to 3,000mAh being standard. Ideally, you'll want a device to take you through an 8-hour workday. Most body cams likely won't be able to last 24 hours since the battery size needs to be balanced against the compact and lightweight design. One option is to get a body cam with more than one battery so you can swap them out when one runs out of juice.

 FAQ

* Can you record other people with a body camera?  
 While there isn't anything stopping you technically, it's often better to ask permission before capturing video of anyone. However, if you are in a public area, you can take photos or videos of your surroundings. Laws surrounding body cameras can vary by state, so if you are concerned about the legalities of constantly recording video, we recommend checking out the [NCSL Body-Worn Camera Laws Database](https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/body-worn-cameras-interactive-graphic.aspx#/) .
* Can you record law enforcement with a body camera?  
 Things become more muddled when using body cameras to record law enforcement. While you are technically allowed to record law enforcement, some states have tried to regulate audio recording under wiretapping laws. We recommend checking out this [ACLU primer](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights) for shooting videos of the police before going further.
* Are police body cameras always on?  
 While an increasing number of police departments are required to wear and use body cameras, those body cameras aren't continuously filming. In most cases, police officers can decide when they have a body camera on. Officers can turn on the body camera before an encounter (or, conversely, turn it off). Moreover, even if the body camera is on, the footage isn't readily accessible to civilians.
