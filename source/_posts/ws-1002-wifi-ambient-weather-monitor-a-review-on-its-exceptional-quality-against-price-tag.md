 What We Like

* Attractive design
* Slim profile
* Comes with a stand
* Good picture quality

 What We Don't Like

* Shorter cable
* Pricier than competitors

 The Antop AT-127 is a stylish antenna that functions well, but it would be even better with a longer cable.

 _We purchased the Antop AT-127 so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review._

[TV antennas](https://www.lifewire.com/choosing-over-the-air-antenna-for-hdtv-4586507) , like the Antop AT-127, are a great way to get local channels without paying a monthly fee. As streaming services have become commonplace, some subscribers don’t have access to live TV and broadcast channels. Some of the[best TV antennas](https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201) provide advanced features, but their designs leave something to be desired. I tested the attractive Antop AT-127 Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a worthy option.

## **Design: Reversible faux wood finish**

 The Antop AT-127 is one of the better-looking antennas I’ve come across. It’s a thin, plastic rectangular antenna that measures 13 inches wide by nine inches tall. At 0.02 inches in thickness, it’s almost paper-thin, but the plastic feels sturdy enough to withstand regular wear and tear.

 The antenna is reversible, with a light oak finish on one side, and darker wood color on the other. It looks less like an eyesore or something you need to hide, and more like an attractive component, you’re willing to display. The pre-attached coaxial cable comes out of the bottom, which is ideal. You can’t remove the cable from the antenna, which isn’t great for storage, but it does promote stable connectivity.

 The antenna comes with a stand for placement on a desk or entertainment center. It also comes with double-sided adhesives, so you can hang it on a wall or window. The adhesives are extremely sticky—when I pulled the antenna off of my wall, the paint came off along with it.

## **Setup: Easier than most**

 Setting up the antenna is relatively intuitive. You just connect the antenna to the coaxial/antenna-in connection on your[TV](https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107) . The antenna has an easy-push connector, instead of a connector you have to twist onto the threading. This makes for easier setup because you don’t have to struggle behind your TV with trying to screw on the[coaxial cable](https://www.lifewire.com/coaxial-vs-optical-digital-cable-3134605) .

 Once you connect the antenna’s cable to your TV, you’ll need to find the best placement. This is perhaps the most difficult part of the setup process. My test home is in a wooded area, and I found the best placement was near or directly on the window. However,[to improve your antenna’s reception](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904) , it’s usually a good idea to place the antenna high up in a room close to the home’s exterior (and nearest to the transmitter towers) and to avoid obstacles like walls and tree cover.

 The antenna has an easy-push connector, instead of a connector you have to screw onto the coax threading.

## **Performance: Almost two dozen channels**

 The Antop AT-127 supports UHF and VHF signals. Overall, it works pretty smoothly, though some channels might have look pixelated for a few seconds when you flip to them or take a second or two to fully load.

 The attached coax cable isn’t as long as I’ve seen on other similarly-priced antennas, but it is long enough (10 feet) to place the antenna up high without an extender.

## **Range: Could be better**

 My test home is in a rural area, and there’s a lot of tree cover on the property. The omnidirectional Antop AT-127 has a 40-mile range, which was enough to pick up local channels from neighboring cities.

 On my first attempt, I used the included stand, and the auto-programming only picked up four channels. When I placed the antenna on a window facing the TV transmitter tower, however, the omnidirectional HD antenna picked up 23 channels, which is a good amount considering the area.

 The omnidirectional Antop AT-127 has a 40-mile range, enough to pick up local channels from neighboring cities.

## **Price: Mid-range**

 The Antop AT-127 retails for $35, which is middle of the road for an indoor TV antenna with the Antop’s specs. Some 50-mile (or longer) range antennas sell for as little as $20 or as much as $100, but the cheaper antennas usually don’t look as nice as the AT-127.

## **Antop AT-127 vs. AmazonBasics Flat TV Antenna**

 You can find indoor antennas for less than $15 (view on[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075ZQXB26/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4845583%7Cna0f30cabffec4337b279a8df3e4c99b015%7C) ). The[AmazonBasics](https://www.lifewire.com/amazonbasics-flat-tv-antenna-review-4845569) 35-mile range antenna is a good example, though it doesn’t come with a stand or have the easy-push connector. Aesth etically, the AmazonBasics antenna doesn’t hold a candle to the Antop antenna, but it does cost significantly less.

 Final Verdict

**Works great & looks even better.**

 Although its range isn’t as long as some of its competitors, the Antop AT-127 picks up channels well and delivers clear high definition television.
