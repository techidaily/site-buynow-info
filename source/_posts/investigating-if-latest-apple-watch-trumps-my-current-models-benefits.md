## Nickelodeon Introduces the Latest NickWatch at Kids' Choice Awards in the U.S

Keeping your kids safe while allowing them some freedom is a solid choice for caregivers.

 The NickWatch, a smartwatch made by Watchinu and licensed via Nickelodeon, gets its US debut Saturday at Walmart.com with a special commercial aired during the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards.

Colorful and useful.

 The NickWatch launched last year in the UK, and was given the[Red Dot Design Award](https://www.red-dot.org/de/project/nickwatch-68476) earlier this year, too. The watch lets kids communicate with parents and other caregivers via SMS and voice calls, has live GPS tracking via the NickWatch app, and has a ton of activities and games with Nickelodeon characters like SpongeBob and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The company promises regular content updates, too, which could help your kiddo avoid boredom with seeing the same stuff over and over.

 "NickWatch is a true disruptor in the wearable tech category for kids, combining world-class Nickelodeon content with unrivaled parental controls and features," said Udi Miron, CEO at Watchinu,[in a statement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/watchinu-brings-award-winning-nickelodeon-smartwatch-for-kids-to-the-us-302195353.html) . "We are bringing to market a smartwatch that is not only fun and enriching, but will grow with the children who wear them for years to come."

 The idea is to empower your kids' independence while keeping them safe, of course, and the NickWatch app offers a subscription ($8 - $13 per month) to do just that with location tracking and communication tools. You can also create an area you want your kids to stay in (a geofence) and get a notification if they go past those boundaries. Parents and caregivers can even mute the watch during school hours and manage who can chat with their kiddo on the watch.

 The NickWatch will retail or $119\. It will be available at Walmart.com Saturday, July 13, and should appear in Walmart stores starting in October.
