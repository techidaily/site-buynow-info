##  What to Look for in a Google Pixel 8a Case

 Picking out a case for a new phone is an important business. Whether you want to make a statement with a bold new look or protect your latest investment, the case you choose will ultimately come down to personal preference. Nevertheless, there are one or two important factors to consider which may help to inform your decision.

 Protection is paramount when it comes to the key considerations. Does the case you're looking at offer Military-grade drop protection, or will it cause costly damage to your phone if it slips from your hand? If you want to keep your Google Pixel 8a well-protected, you should look for something that can comfortably withstand shocks, knocks, and drops.

 Are you planning to charge your Google Pixel 8a wirelessly? If so, you may want to concentrate on cases supporting wireless charging. After all, you don't want to have the fiddly inconvenience of removing your phone cover whenever you need to charge your phone.

 Does the case offer a textured grip? A comfortable, non-slip grip is essential if your phone is likely to remain in your hand for long periods. Perhaps you prefer something that offers convenient storage for your cards and cash, giving you fewer things to remember when you leave the house or office? If so, you might want to consider a wallet-style case for your Pixel 8a.

 However you're looking to accessorize your Google Pixel 8a, there's no shortage of choices out there. In our guide below, we've hand-picked some of the best options available, to cater to every need and budget.

 Made from flexible [TPU](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/), this case is easy to apply and surprisingly durable. Inside, you'll find a unique spider-web-style engraving that adds an extra layer of shock absorption, while Air Cushion technology reinforces each corner against drop damage. Plus, ventilated edges allow for effective heat dissipation, keeping your Pixel 8a cooler longer.

| Pros                              | Cons                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Military-grade drop protection    | The extra padded design won't appeal to everyone |
| Compatible with wireless charging |                                                  |
| Drop-proof grip                   |                                                  |

 The [Caseology Athlex](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Athlex-Google-Integrated-Military/dp/B0CLFHDB3N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003270&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-google-pixel-8a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is another excellent option for your Google Pixel 8a. Due to current discounts (at the time of writing), it stands out as one of the best budget-priced options available. Made from TPU material, the Athlex boasts [Military-Grade drop protection](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/are-opinions-on-goods-compensated-in-videos-for-2024/), effective for canceling drop damage from heights up to 48 inches.

 Thanks to the extra cushioning and accent lines across its back, it has a unique look. This textured design offers a decent amount of grip, further reinforced by a microdot side grip pattern, effectively reducing the chance of your phone slipping out of your hand. Plus, lifted edges also provide some welcome protection against everyday scratch damage.

 Precision cutouts are made for the Pixel 8a's charging port and camera lens, and the Athlex adds responsive buttons to its outer shell. Best of all, despite the extra cushioning on the outside of the case, it is still compatible with wireless charging, so it wins extra points for practicality.

 If you're after a unique look for your Google Pixel 8a and don't mind the minor increase in bulk that the Athlex gives, you'll appreciate its style. And for the time being at least, you'll most definitely appreciate the discounted price point.

| Reasonable price point             | Offers minimal protection against drop damage |

| Plenty of space for cash and cards |                                               |

 If the words retro and leather pique your interest, you'll want to check out the [CaseMe Retro Leather Wallet Case](https://www.casemecase.com/product/caseme-023-google-pixel-8a-case-black/) for Google Pixel 8a. Made from retro-style PU leather with a TPU inner case, it's ideal for keeping your phone, cards, and cash all in one place. And for added security, it has built-in RFID technology to prevent unauthorized scanning of your credit card information.

 The case can be folded into a supported stand for watching videos, and a magnetic clasp ensures the front cover can be securely closed. For added convenience, a built-in receiver hole allows you to answer your phone with the case closed, and a precision cutout keeps your camera clear for use as well.

 In terms of practical protection, the front cover provides adequate protection for your Google Pixel 8a's screen when closed, and the corners offer some protection against drop damage thanks to a slight overlap in the double-layer leather. However, it offers very little in terms of rugged protection, with the primary security feature being the RFID-blocking fabric woven into the cardholder.

 The CaseMe Retro Leather Wallet case looks and feels like a premium-quality product despite its affordable price point. It is ideal for anybody who likes a wallet-style case and wants to keep all their valuables together but doesn't want to pay top dollar for the privilege.

 The [Natbok Case](https://www.amazon.com/Natbok-Google-Pixel-8a-Shockproof/dp/B0CX91BHL3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003270&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-google-pixel-8a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for Google Pixel 8a offers slim protection with an affordable price tag. This precision-cut case measures just 2 mm in thickness along the raised bezels and is 3 mm thick on the camera guard, making it one of the slimmest cases currently available for the Google Pixel 8a. It provides precise cutouts for the charging port, speakers, microphone, and camera.

 Despite its slim form factor, this case is surprisingly robust. Made from lightweight and flexible TPU, it offers good abrasion resistance and protects against scratch damage. Shock-absorbing Air Guard corners help disperse impact damage from accidental drops, and the case has been Military-grade drop tested at heights of 8.6 feet.

 Thanks to a carbon fiber texture and an anti-slip surface, the Natbok Case should stay fingerprint-free while offering a comfortable grip. In addition, an integrated heatsink helps keep your phone cool while in use, conveniently dissipating any buildup of heat.

 With a budget-friendly price point to boot, the Natbok Case for Google Pixel 8a is a great option for anybody who doesn't want to add unnecessary bulk to their phone but still wants to give it decent protection against damage.
