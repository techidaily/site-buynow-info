## Ultimate Selection of Controller Options for Enhanced Mobile Gaming Performance

Touchscreen controls are fine for mobile gaming, but nothing beats that feeling of analog buttons and physical joysticks. Controllers offer superior feedback, and you don't need a console to use one. With a controller connected to your phone or tablet, you’ll never return to the touchscreen again.

##  What to Look for in a Mobile Gaming Controller

 There's more to finding the right mobile gaming controller than good buttons. How do you know your pick will even work with your phone? Ideally, you want to focus on compatibility, features, and comfort—preferably in that order.

 Being sure the controller is compatible is of the utmost importance. Take the Razer Kishi V2, for example. It has separate models for Android and iOS, meaning you could purchase a controller that doesn’t work for you.

 What kind of features should you consider? Fitting your phone is certainly important, especially if it accommodates your case. Having a headphone jack is useful, otherwise you’ll have to switch to [wireless earbuds](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/locked-out-of-apple-iphone-xs-max-5-ways-to-get-into-a-locked-apple-iphone-xs-max-by-drfone-ios/). You also want to be on the lookout for passthrough charging, which lets you charge your phone and game at the same time.

 Lastly, the best mobile controllers tend to provide comfort and feedback. Look for rounded edges, clicky buttons, and textured grips. That kind of ergonomic design goes a long way if you plan on gaming regularly on your phone.

| Latency isn't a problem due to a direct connection |                             |

 The most positive aspect of the [GameSir G8 Galileo](https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-G8-Galileo-Controller-Joysticks/dp/B0CM3C9HRG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004345&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-controllers-for-mobile-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is its design, which resembles that of an Xbox controller rather than the Switch-like, rectangular controllers. Not that those types of controllers aren’t comfortable—the Backbone One and Razer Kishi V2 are shining examples—but the G8 feels more natural.

 Speaking of the controls, GameSir G8 Galileo is rocking hall effect joysticks and triggers, eliminating drifting in the joysticks and offering superior response time in the triggers. The extra two back buttons are a welcome addition, as is the grippy texture around the handles.

 Lastly, the GameSir G8 Galileo has passthrough charging and a headset jack, which lets you charge your device and continue gaming. The pivoting connector is also an ingenious design, given that it can move around to fit different phone sizes, ultimately avoiding any bending that happens over time.

| Up to 20 hours of battery life     | Phone clip is sold separately |
| Textured grips to prevent slipping |                               |
| Great retro design                 |                               |

 The feeling of a full controller can’t be beaten, and you only look to our best overall controller to see its influence—but it can be expensive. The [8Bitdo Pro 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSPH1JYV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004345&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-controllers-for-mobile-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is just the kind of budget-friendly controller that makes mobile gaming even more fun and lets you save some cash for more video games at the same time.

 The 8Bitdo Pro 2 has quite the list of features. For starters, the Hall Effect joysticks are fantastic. Like the GameSir G8 Galileo, they are designed so that drifting isn’t an issue. It’s almost fitting that the 8Bitdo Pro 2 looks like a retro SNES controller, considering the growing list of classics that have been ported to Android and iOS.

 The 8Bitdo Pro 2’s best feature is arguably its compatibility. Why stop at mobile gaming? There’s a four-way mode that lets you switch between connected devices, including PC, Nintendo Switch, Android, and iOS. If it’s strictly mobile gaming, then consider grabbing the [8Bitdo Pro 2 Mobile Clip](https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-mobile-clip-for-pro-2-bluetooth-controller), designed specifically for mounting your phone.

| Pros                                             | Cons                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Buttons have console-like quality and feedback   | Thumbsticks are small |
| Very sturdy bridge                               |                       |
| Choose between Xbox and PlayStation face buttons |                       |

 The 2nd generation of the [Backbone One](https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-iOS/dp/B0CCT2LWT8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004345&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-controllers-for-mobile-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is better than ever, so much so that it’s arguably the best option if you own an iPhone, including the iPhone 15\. Having a USB-C for direct connection eliminates the worry of latency, and if you need to charge your phone, which you will, it supports passthrough charging, too.

 Of course, the Backbone One’s buttons are the crowning jewels here. Both the D-pad and the buttons have the tactile feedback of a dedicated console controller, with notably large, ultra-wide triggers. It makes it incredibly easy to transition to mobile gaming if you’re familiar with consoles.

 Aside from the buttons, the Backbone One’s case support has also been massively improved over the first-generation model. The trick is the magnetic adapter included with the controller, which you'll likely use if your [iPhone case](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-discovering-one-platform-play-in-apex-legends-without-cross-play-complications/) is on the bulky side. Ultimately, it means you don't have to sacrifice the protection of your _very_ expensive phone for the sake of relaxation.

##  Best Mobile Gaming Controller for Android: [Razer Kishi V2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B16NGTCT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004345&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-controllers-for-mobile-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                                          | Cons                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Clicky buttons                                | Lacks a headphone jack |
| Rounded edges feel good                       |                        |
| Compact design, making it easy to travel with |                        |

 Touchscreen controls are novel, but the lack of physical feedback is a bummer for gaming. Luckily, the [Razer Kishi V2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B16NGTCT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004345&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-controllers-for-mobile-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has a solution: just remap the touchscreen controls to the controller’s buttons. There are even two extra buttons right next to the triggers that you can use to map macrosusing the same Razer Nexus app.

 Speaking of buttons, the clicky feedback of the microswitches is wonderful. You’ll notice it most on the menu buttons, but the triggers have them as well, in addition to being analog. The rounded edges and shape also fit nicely in the hands and there’s a texture underneath to prevent slipping.

 Overall, the Razer Kishi V2 is far sturdier and doesn’t bend nearly as much as the first generation. The bridge is thicker and has a telescopic design, letting you adjust the controller to the size of your phone much easier and quicker than before. There’s even some extra room if your Android has a thicker case.

### What controllers work with my mobile device?

 For controllers, it's on a case-by-case basis. Some controllers, like the GameSir G8 Galileo, support both Android and iOS. Others, like the Razer Kishi V2, have separate models configured for both operating systems.

 What's important is that you read the fine print and double-check the controller supports your operating system and version.

### Can I use a PS5 controller with my phone?

 Yes, on Android and iOS! To connect a PS5 controller to your phone (or tablet):

1. Enable Bluetooth on your phone.
2. Press and hold the PS button and the Create button (the three dashes) at the same time.
3. Select the controller from the Bluetooth menu and pair them.

 Alternatively, you can connect your PS5 controller via USB-C cable and directly connect to your phone.

### Can I use an Xbox Core controller with my phone?

 Yes! Just like with PS5 controllers, the Xbox Core controller is supported by Android and iOS:

1. Enable Bluetooth on your phone.
2. Press and hold the pairing button on the Xbox Core controller. It's the little button next to the left bumper.
3. On your phone, select the Xbox Core controller from the Bluetooth menu and pair.

 As with the PS5 controller, you can go for a direct connection too, using a USB cable.

### Will phone controllers also work with tablets?

 It depends on the controller. What you're looking for is a phone controller that connects wirelessly, by Bluetooth, or one that allows you to directly connect via the USB port on the tablet. The 8Bitdo Pro 2, for example, has Bluetooth and can connect to devices using a cable.
