## Experience Crystal Clear Viewing: Sling TV Adds New 4K Content for Superior Picture Quality

Sling TV is one of the most popular alternatives to cable and satellite TV. Starting today, Sling TV will offer select broadcasts in 4K, at no extra charge to subscribers.

 Sling TV announced that FOX Sports’ 25th broadcast of the MLB All-Star Game on July 16th will be the platform’s first live 4K broadcast. The service plans to offer more live sports in 4K over the coming months, including 2024 Paris Olympics coverage on USA Network, as well as college and pro football games on FS1, ESPN, and other channels.

 There are some catches to 4K support. You need an internet connection of at least 20 Mbps, and smart TV or streaming device that supports 4K. Sling TV currently allows 4K playback on the Roku 4K, Roku Stream Bar, Roku Ultra, Roku Express 4K+ / Streaming Stick 4K+, 4K Roku TV, Fire TV Stick 4K, 4K Max, and the Fire TV Cube. There are a lot of devices missing from that list, like Xbox consoles, Chromecasts, and game consoles, but it’s a start.

 The feature also depends on the broadcaster offering a 4K version, which is why it’s limited to certain events and leagues. DVR support is “coming soon,” according to the company. There’s no word on any channels or broadcasts outside of live sports getting 4K support.

 DirecTV, Dish TV (owned by the same parent company as Sling), Xfinity, YouTube TV, and other providers already offered 4K support. However, Sling is currently not charging anything extra for 4K support, unlike most other TV services. For example, 4K streaming with YouTube TV requires the [4K Plus add-on](https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/10383365), which currently costs $10 per month on its own.

 You can [sign up for Sling TV](https://sling-tv.pxf.io/c/156932/1132376/14334?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2004192&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2F) from the company’s website. There’s also a [4K support page](https://sling-tv.pxf.io/c/156932/1132376/14334?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2004192&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fhelp%2Fen%2F4k) with more information about 4K broadcasts.
