## What Is LinkedIn Premium?

[LinkedIn Premium](https://premium.linkedin.com/) is a paid subscription service with advanced features unavailable in the free version. These features include InMail messaging tokens to reach out to people not in your network, detailed profile views, company insights, access to LinkedIn Learning, personalized AI suggestions, private browsing, and more. Premium is offered in different tiers such as Premium Career, Business, Sales Navigator, and Recruiter Lite, each tailored to different professional needs.

 The cost of a LinkedIn Premium annual subscription depends on the account tier you choose. The lowest-priced tier is the LinkedIn Premium Career subscription, which costs $29.99 per month or $239 annually. LinkedIn Premium Career suits most career seekers looking to get hired and professionally network in their industry.

### AI Writing Assistant

 A Write with AI button generates suggestions to improve the wording and headlines in your profile.

### Unlimited Searches

 With a LinkedIn Premium, you can carry our unlimited searches up to 3rd-degree connections. A commercial use limit restricts these searches in a LinkedIn Free account.

### Browsing Privacy

 With a Premium account, you can browse in private mode and still see a list of people who dropped into your profile in the last 90 days.

## Why You Don't Need a LinkedIn Premium Subscription

 Casual users can still maintain a professional profile on LinkedIn Basic and apply for jobs. You may not need LinkedIn Premium for several other reasons.

### Proactive Networking

 LinkedIn Premium isn't necessary if you are not interested in deep networking for business or recruitment.

### Cost

 The cost can be prohibitive, especially for those who are starting their careers. The Basic (free) plan allows you to connect with others and build your network while giving and receiving recommendations.

### Job Insights

 You don't need a LinkedIn Premium subscription if you don't need access to competitive intelligence about a job or a company. You can still search for jobs and use alternative search tools to gather market intelligence.

### Recruitment

 You don't need a subscription if your company is using another recruitment tool.

### Professional Development

 LinkedIn Learning courses are helpful, but many other online learning courses can be accessed for free or at a lower cost.

## Are LinkedIn Premium Benefits Worth It?

 LinkedIn Premium is a worthy investment for your career or business if you have the budget.

 But remember, the decision to pay for a LinkedIn Premium subscription or go with the free LinkedIn Basic lies in the level of access you want to your professional network.

 LinkedIn Premium isn't cheap, and you must balance your needs with the features you want to take advantage of. For instance, a subscription can be a good investment for recruiters and entrepreneurs. It may not be one for someone on the cusp of a career. Before you decide, score the features with an estimate of how and how much you will put them to use for specific scenarios.
