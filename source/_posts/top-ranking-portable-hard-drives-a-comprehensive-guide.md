## Top-Ranking Portable Hard Drives : A Comprehensive Guide

If your workflow demands [external storage](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-comparing-reels-and-stories-whats-your-preference/) or you often move data between different computers, an external SSD is a much better choice than an external HDD or something like an SD card.

##  What to Consider When Shopping for an External SSD in 2024

 The most important things to look out for when shopping for an external [solid-state drive](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-gradual-glide-out-technique-for-audio-in-adobe-premiere-pro/) (SSD) are its speed and compatibility with your machine. While high-end portable SSDs can achieve speeds up to 40Gpbs, they won’t achieve those speeds on every PC.

 For example, 40Gbps external SSDs usually pack [USB4](https://location-social.techidaily.com/why-your-whatsapp-location-is-not-updating-and-how-to-fix-on-apple-iphone-xs-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) or [Thunderbolt](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-quick-conversion-tips-using-vlc-for-mpeg-4-and-beyond/) ports and can only achieve 40Gbps when connected via USB4 or compatible Thunderbolt ports. Then, we’ve got 20Gbps drives, most of which can transfer data at those speeds only when connected via a [USB 3.2x2](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-craft-powerful-tags-for-maximum-youtube-engagement/) port, rated for 20Gbps bandwidth. Connect such a drive to a Mac, and you’re limited to 10Gbps because Macs only support up to 10Gbps via USB 3.2 ports. In other words, don’t spend extra on a fast external SSD if you can’t use its full potential.

 Next up, you should think about the storage size. Nowadays, 1TB is the sweet spot price-wise, but the good news is that a number of models sport very attractive prices for 2TB variants, meaning you don’t have to pay an exuberant amount of money for 2TB of storage. You’ve got budget external SSDs with 2TB capacity that will set you back as low as $150\. If you place capacity over speed, I strongly advise getting a budget portable SSD instead of overpaying for a fast 2TB drive.

 Other aspects to consider are design and ruggedness. If you plan on taking the drive everywhere with you, you might consider getting a rugged external SSD with an Ingress Protection (IP) rating, one that’s resistant to the intrusion of dust or liquids. Design-wise, if you can’t decide between two similar SSDs, pick the one you like more, especially if you plan on using it daily!

 Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s check out the best external SSDs you can buy.

##  Best External SSD Overall: [ADATA SE920](https://us-shop.adata.com/adata-se920-usb4-40gbps-type-c-1tb-external-ssd/) 

![Adata SE920 against a blue background.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/adata-se920.jpg) 

_Adata_

| Pros                                       | Cons                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Ultra-fast for an external SSD           | ✗ Comes with active cooling                     |
| ✓ Slick-looking                            | ✗ Pricey unless you buy it on Adata's web store |
| ✓ Almost as fast on Thunderbolt as on USB4 |                                                 |
| ✓ Decently priced at Adata's webstore      |                                                 |
| ✓ 5-year warranty                          |                                                 |

 The [ADATA SE920](https://us-shop.adata.com/adata-se920-usb4-40gbps-type-c-1tb-external-ssd/) is an impressive external SSD that can reach read speeds of 40Gbps. The drive is USB4 compatible, but you can also use it on Thunderbolt devices. When connected to a USB4 port, it can achieve a sequential write speed of up to 3,700MBps, and when you hook it up to a compatible Thunderbolt port, you’re looking at sequential write speeds of up to 3,200MBps.

 The sequential read speed tops out at 3,800MBps, no matter whether you’re using USB4 or Thunderbolt. This is good news for Mac owners because they usually have to settle for 10Gbps speeds when using 20Gbps USB 3.2x2 external drives. The package includes the SSD and a USB4 Type-C to C cable you’ll need to use to achieve the rated read/write speeds. Note that when hooked to a slower port—USB 3.2 10Gbps or USB 3.2x2 20Gbps—its speed will be limited according to the maximum bandwidth of the USB port.

 Aside from blazing-fast speeds, the SE920 is a looker, too. It features a stylish design with an extendable casing that, once extended, activates a tiny fan to keep the SSD cool when working in USB4 mode.

 The negatives include the aforementioned fan, which is audible but needed because the drive can get toasty when used in USB4 mode. Also, the ADATA SE920 is quite pricey on third-party websites. Luckily, if you get it directly from Adata’s websites, the asking price is much easier to swallow.

 If you want a lighting-fast option you can buy off Amazon, take a look at the [SABRENT Rocket Nano XTRM](https://www.amazon.com/SABRENT-Rocket-External-2700MBps-SB-XTMN-1TB/dp/B0CD2TVQ98?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which features Thunderbolt 3 connectivity and achieves read/write speeds up to 2700MBps.

Best External SSD Overall

#####  ADATA SE920

The ADATA SE920 is one of the fastest external SSDs around, but the catch is that the drive doesn't sport a ridiculously high price. Aside from the excellent price, the SE920 also boasts an attractive design, blazing fast read/write speeds, and three different capacities.

##  Best Budget External SSD: [Crucial X9](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-1TB-Portable-SSD-CT1000X9SSD902/dp/B0CGW1FQV4?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Crucial X9 connected to a laptop.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/crucial-x9.jpg) 

_Crucial_

| Pros                             | Cons                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Killer Price for the 1TB model | ✗ The 4TB version is a expensive compared to other budget options |
| ✓ Respectable Performance        |                                                                   |
| ✓ Compact Design                 |                                                                   |

 The [Crucial X9](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-1TB-Portable-SSD-CT1000X9SSD902/dp/B0CGW1FQV4?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a fantastic budget SSD that combines a super affordable price with superb performance. This is no surprise, considering Micron, one of the largest flash storage manufacturers, owns Crucial.

 The drive tops out at 1,050MBps for sequential read, and is noticeably slower when it comes to write speeds, which hover at around 500MBps. Still, this is a respectable result for a budget external SSD, and you won’t find many drives that can achieve those speeds while sporting a similarly affordable price.

 Regarding design, the Crucial X9 looks fantastic with its slightly rounded edges and tiny footprint. The [Kingston XS1000](https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Performance-Pocket-Sized-SXS2000-1000G/dp/B0CCQB7BN7/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) X9 is compatible with a wide range of devices, including PCs, Macs, Android phones, and gaming consoles. You only have to remember that, to achieve maximum read/write speeds, you have to use a USB 3.2 Gen2 port.

 You can get the Crucial X9 in 1GB, 2TB, and 4TB sizes, with the 4TB version being a bit too expensive for what it offers. And while the 2TB version has a decent price, I recommend the [Lexar SL200](https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-SL200-Portable-Type-C-External/dp/B088N1PGTG?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) because it’s extremely inexpensive and offers pretty solid performance. If you need something smaller than the X9, check out the [Kingston XS1000](https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Pocket-Sized-External-SXS1000-1000G/dp/B0CCQB7BN7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It’s super compact while sporting a similar price and performance to the Crucial X9.

## ![A person holding an LaCie Rugged SSD Pro.](https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lacie-rugged-ssd-pro.jpg) 

| Pros                               | Cons             |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| ✓ Blazing fast                     | ✗ Very expensive |
| ✓ IP67 rating                      |                  |
| ✓ 5-year warranty                  |                  |
| ✓ Compatible with USB 3.2 and USB4 |                  |
| ✓ Fantastic build quality          |                  |

 The [LaCie Rugged SSD Pro](https://www.amazon.com/LaCie-Rugged-Solid-State-Drive/dp/B07X1ZMFKG?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) with USB-C connectivity sports the IP67 rating, meaning you can drop it from heights up to 3M/9.8ft and immerse it in water for up to 1 minute without damaging it. The drive is also dust-resistant and comes with a 5-year warranty.

 The rated speeds top out at 2,800MBps for sequential read and sequential write, and the drive mostly lives up to the performance promised in [real-world tests](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/lacie-rugged-ssd-pro). Because it's a rugged external SSD, the drive is compact but still bulkier than most regular portable SSDs.

 Design-wise, the orange enclosure makes it an eye-catching device, and the details on the casing allow it to stand out from the crowd. The selling package includes a Thunderbolt 2 cable that’s a bit short but does the job. And despite this being a Thunderbolt 3 drive, it's compatible with USB 3.2 and USB4 standards. The only limitation is slower read and write speeds when connected to USB4 and USB 3.2 devices.

 Regarding negatives, the price is quite high compared to other rugged external SSD solutions. Still, given its perfomance, it's worth the premium price tag.

 Check out the [LaCie Rugged Mini SSD](https://www.amazon.com/LaCie-Rugged-500GB-Solid-State/dp/B0C349NKQK?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) if you want something more affordable with an IP54 rating. The [Samsung T7 Shield](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Shield-4TB-Portable-SSD/dp/B09VLK9W3S?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), on the other hand, is similar to the LaCie Rugged SSD Pro, but it only has an IP65 rating. Conversely, the T7 Shield is much easier to find online.

##  Best Small External SSD: [SK Hynix Beetle X31](https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-Windows-Based-Android-Based-Smartphones/dp/B0C4KNB2YK?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

_SK Hynix_

| Pros                      | Cons                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ✓ It looks adorable       | ✗ Only comes with a 3-year warranty |
| ✓ Solid performance       |                                     |
| ✓ Very compact            |                                     |
| ✓ Excellent build quality |                                     |

 The [SK Hynix Beetle X31](https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-Windows-Based-Android-Based-Smartphones/dp/B0C4KNB2YK?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) doesn’t just look adorable—this small external SSD has great performance as well. The drive fits in the palm of your hand, supports read speeds of up to 1050MBps, has a USB 3.2 Gen2 interface, and is compatible with PCs, Macs, and gaming consoles. Just note that the Beetle will work slower if not connected to a USB 3.2 Gen2 port.

 The rated sequential write speed of 1,000MBps aligns with what other similarly compact portable SSDs offer. Considering the stylish design and the classy-looking champagne gold finish, it’s good that SK Hynix provides a protective rubber bumper for the drive to protect it from scratches and nicks.

 The selling package includes the drive and a USB-C 3.2 Gen2 cable. While the price is right compared to the competition, the 3-year warranty could’ve been longer. Another potential stumbling point for the Beetle is that it tops out at 1TB, which isn’t ideal in a world where 2TB external SSDs are more commonplace.

 If you need something faster and are fine with paying more, the [Kingston XS2000](https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Performance-Pocket-Sized-SXS2000-1000G/dp/B09F5YHQ1K/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is just what the doctor ordered. Just note that you’ll need a USB 3.2x2 port to get the most out of the XS2000\. And if the Beetle X31 is too pricey, the [Crucial X9](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-1TB-Portable-SSD-CT1000X9SSD902/dp/B0CGW1FQV4?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Kingston XS1000](https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Performance-Pocket-Sized-SXS2000-1000G/dp/B0CCQB7BN7/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) are more affordable and come in 2TB sizes.

_Western Digital_

| Pros                          | Cons            |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- |
| ✓ Speedy                      | ✗ Expensive     |
| ✓ Excellent industrial design | ✗ No 4TB option |
| ✓ Tasteful RGB implementation |                 |
| ✓ Superb build quality        |                 |
| ✓ 5-year warranty             |                 |

 Gamers looking for a quality portable SSD should look no further than the [Western Digital P40](https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBLACK-1TB-Game-Drive-WDBAWY0010BBK-WESN/dp/B09ZRD38D8?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This beast is capable of achieving up to 2,000MBps reading speed and 2,000MBps write speed.

 The P40 is encased inside a shock-proof housing with a slightly aggressive industrial design. Aside from the aggro design, another gamer-centric detail is RGB, found on both sides of the housing. It’s not too bright and looks pretty cool, but the RGB software is only available on Windows.

 While the drive’s pretty darn fast on Windows machines when hooked to a USB 3.2 Gen2x2 port, you should know that you won’t be able to get the same performance on the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles because they don’t have USB 3.2 Gen2x2 ports. The same applies to Mac users, who are limited to 10Gbps instead of 20Gbps.

 If you don’t care about gaming-heavy design and want a solid portable SSD to store your games on, check out the [Kingston XS2000](https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Performance-Pocket-Sized-SXS2000-1000G/dp/B09F5YHQ1K/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which offers the same performance but is more affordable. If you don’t read and write speeds of up to 2,000MBps, the [Crucial X9](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-1TB-Portable-SSD-CT1000X9SSD902/dp/B0CGW1FQV4?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent budget option. Both drives support current-gen gaming consoles. Finally, if you want the absolute fastest external storage for your gaming needs and own a machine with USB4 connectivity, you can’t go wrong with the [ADATA SE920](https://us-shop.adata.com/adata-se920-usb4-40gbps-type-c-1tb-external-ssd/).

##  Best External SSD for Mac: [Samsung T7](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-SSD-1TB-MU-PC1T0T/dp/B0874XN4D8?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Samsung T7 connected to a laptop.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/samsung-t7.jpg) 

_Samsung_ 

| Pros                      | Cons                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ✓ Works great with Macs   | ✗ There are faster options out there |
| ✓ Compact and lightweight | ✗ A 5-year warranty would be nice    |
| ✓ Decently priced         |                                      |
| ✓ Solid performance       |                                      |

 Considering that Mac computers top out at 10Gbps over the USB 3.2 connection, no matter if it's the regular Gen2 10Gbps or Gen2x2 20Gbps port, there’s no reason to get a 20Gbps portable SSD if you own a Mac. This fact makes the [Samsung T7](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-SSD-1TB-MU-PC1T0T/dp/B0874XN4D8?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) the best external SSD solution for most Mac owners.

 The drive in question features read and write speeds up to 1050MBps, which is more than enough for most users. The T7 is also very compact, sports a solid price, is available in capacities ranging from 500GB to 4TB, and comes with AES 256-bit hardware encryption.

 The design is minimal yet attractive, and the fact that you can get the T7 in three colors is a definite plus. On the other hand, the three-year warranty could’ve been longer, especially considering this is a Samsung SSD using Samsung-made flash storage. The price of the 2TB and 4TB versions is also higher than what the competition sells at.

 The [Crucial X9 Pro for Mac](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Pro-1TB-Portable-CT1000X9PROSSD902/dp/B0CLYZZP8K?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003518&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-external-ssds%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent alternative because it offers similar performance and a lower price for the 2TB and 4TB models. If you own a Mac with Thunderbolt 3 or 4 connectivity and want something fast, the 40Gbps ADATA SE920 is your best bet. [ADATA SE920](https://us-shop.adata.com/adata-se920-usb4-40gbps-type-c-1tb-external-ssd/)

## FAQ

### What does SSD stand for?

 SSD stands for Solid State Drive. 

### What is the difference between a hard drive and a solid state drive?

 Solid state drives use flash memory and do not contain moving parts, unlike hard drives that use spinning magnetic disks (also known as platters) to store data and include moving parts. Performance-wise, even the slowest solid state drive is faster than the fastest hard drive.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### How long do SSDs last?

 In general, SSDs are quite durable. You should expect at least five years of service from an average SSD, with many models being able to provide more than a decade of service.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Are SSDs more reliable than HDDs?

 Generally, modern SSDs are more reliable than HDDs since they do not contain moving parts and utilize flash memory that's pretty durable nowadays. 

### Are internal or external SSDs faster?

 On average, internal SSDs are faster than external SSDs. While a budget internal SSD using the SATA interface may be slower than a flagship external SSD using Thunderbolt or USB4 connectivity, high-end internal SSDs leave their high-end external counterparts in the dust in terms of performance.
