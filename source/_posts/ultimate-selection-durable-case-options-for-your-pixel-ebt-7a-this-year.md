##  What to Look For in a Google Pixel 7a Case in 2023

 Unlike many premium smartphones, the [Google Pixel 7a](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/nlocking-the-secrets-to-parallel-playback-prowess-for-2024/) doesn't feature a fragile glass back. That said, it's still important to keep the phone protected, but there are almost too many options to choose from.

 The first factor to consider is your budget. Cases are typically fairly affordable, but some can range up to $60 or more, depending on features. The type of material you choose---leather, for example---can impact the price significantly.

 Some materials, like [thermoplastic polyurethane](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/) (TPU), offer better protection than others. Various features like impact cushions can add extra protection on top of the type of material used. Some cases are drop-tested up to a certain height.

 You'll also need to consider the form factor. While a big, bulky case often adds protection, it makes your phone bulkier and harder to use. A thin case offers a form factor closer to using the phone without a case, but these typically don't add as much protection.

 Once you've settled on the basics, it's time to think about whether you want any extra features. For example, wallet cases let you store cash and credit cards alongside your phone, while clear cases let you show off your Pixel 7a's design while still protecting it.

 Finally, it's worth considering whether you need a case at all. There are some worthwhile [arguments for using your phone without a case](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/unleashing-the-full-potential-of-game-characters-with-voice-alteration-strategies-free/).

 The best phone cases are a delicate balance of form and function, adding utility without making your phone look overly bulky or ugly. The [Caseology Parallax for Google Pixel 7a](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Parallax-Military-Enhanced-Ergonomic/dp/B0BL24XN4Z?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a perfect example of an excellent blend between protection and usability.

 Let's start with the 3D Hexa Cube design that Caseology uses on the Parallax. This adds a unique look to the case but is far from purely aesthetic. This design also adds grip, making your phone far less likely to skip down the sidewalk. Whether you drop your Pixel 7a or set it down, raised bezels protect the screen.

 The Parallax is far from a rugged phone case, but Caseology advertises it is "certified with military-grade protection" on its Amazon listing. It's also thin enough that it won't interfere with wireless charging, so you never have to remove the case to charge your phone.

 The Caseology Parallax for Google Pixel 7a is available in [Burgundy](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Parallax-Military-Enhanced-Ergonomic/dp/B0BL24XN4Z?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Matte Black](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Parallax-Military-Enhanced-Ergonomic/dp/B0BL23NB2S?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Midnight Blue](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Parallax-Military-Enhanced-Ergonomic/dp/B0BL23NB2S?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), and [Sage Green](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Parallax-Military-Enhanced-Ergonomic/dp/B0BL22PB51?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 If you're already carrying your phone and need a case, why carry a wallet too? That's precisely the type of thinking behind the [iCoverCase for Google Pixel 7a Wallet Case](https://www.amazon.com/iCoverCase-Kickstand-Adjustable-Crossbody-Magnetic/dp/B0BWYDWW2C?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), which goes above and beyond the features you typically see in wallet-style cases.

 This case features four card slots and a cash slot, but that's not all. In addition to these, there is also a zippered pocket, which is handy for change or anything small that you want to ensure doesn't fall out of the case while you're using your phone.

 Unlike most wallet cases, this model also features a detachable, adjustable crossbody strap, useful for anyone wearing clothing that doesn't feature much in the way of pockets. Like many wallet cases, the iCoverCase also features a kickstand mode, perfect for watching videos on your phone.

 Depending on the color you choose, the case uses either faux leather or fabric outer material. This case is available in six color varieties: [Black](https://www.amazon.com/iCoverCase-Kickstand-Adjustable-Crossbody-Magnetic/dp/B0BWYDWW2C?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Blue](https://www.amazon.com/iCoverCase-Kickstand-Adjustable-Crossbody-Magnetic/dp/B0BWYCJ6QP?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Claret](https://www.amazon.com/iCoverCase-Kickstand-Adjustable-Crossbody-Magnetic/dp/B0BWYBGGSY?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Green](https://www.amazon.com/iCoverCase-Kickstand-Adjustable-Crossbody-Magnetic/dp/B0BWYBF7S4?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Purple](https://www.amazon.com/iCoverCase-Kickstand-Adjustable-Crossbody-Magnetic/dp/B0BWYBLYZK?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), and [Rose Gold](https://www.amazon.com/iCoverCase-Kickstand-Adjustable-Crossbody-Magnetic/dp/B0BWYFC99G?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 If your life is somewhat incompatible with the fragileness of a smartphone, a rugged case will help you keep it in one piece. The [Poetic Guardian Series Case for Google Pixel 7a](https://www.amazon.com/Poetic-Mil-Grade-Protector-Fingerprint-Shockproof/dp/B0BZ4CF3KW?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) will keep your phone protected, front and back, from any angle you can think of.

 According to the Amazon listing, one of the most impressive aspects of the Poetic Guardian Series case is that its mil-grade drop tested from 20 feet. It's not too likely you'll drop your phone that far, but it's nice to know that the case has your back if you do. Don't worry about water either, as this case features port covers to protect your Pixel 7a.

 Unlike most cases, this model includes a tempered glass screen protector built into a sturdy front frame. If you would rather not use a screen protector, or if you have another protector you prefer, Poetic includes a second front frame without a screen protector. Both frames have raised bezels to protect your screen.

 Nobody likes a bulky phone. If they did, manufacturers wouldn't constantly be producing thinner and thinner phones. Adding a case means adding some bulk to your phone, but as the [Spigen Liquid Air Designed for Pixel 7a](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-MP610-Case/dp/B0BKR1RB4T?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) shows, it doesn't have to add much.

 The Liquid Air case wraps tightly around the Pixel 7a, adding just 0.07 inches of extra depth. There's a decent amount of mil-grade protection here too, with air cushions to help absorb shocks, even at the corners.

 Look closely at the case, and you'll see the design is made up of many tiny triangles. This anti-slip surface helps prevent losing your grip on the phone, which can be more common with thin cases.

 As thin as it is, the Spigen Liquid Air Designed for Pixel 7a case doesn't interfere with wireless charging. The case is available in [Matte Black](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-MP610-Case/dp/B0BKR1RB4T?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and [Abyss Green](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-MP610-Case/dp/B0BTK7XT8P?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

#####  Spigen Liquid Air Designed for Pixel 7a Case

 If you're going for a more professional look for your phone, a leather case is a great way to go, as these still offer plenty of protection. The [Banzoc Case for Google Pixel 7a](https://www.amazon.com/Banzoc-Google-Pixel-Anti-Scratch-2023/dp/B0BYZ8CF5H?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) isn't a wallet case, as many leather cases are, which is great if you prefer your case on the thin side.

 While this is a leather case, it's not all leather. The interior is made of a plastic composite shell, covered with a layer of soft TPU to absorb shocks. The leather sits on the outside of these two layers, adding its unique look and own form of protection.

 A raised 1mm lip around the screen and another 1.7mm lip around the camera lenses keeps the glass well-protected. The Banzoc Case for Google Pixel 7a supports wireless charging and is available in [Brown](https://www.amazon.com/Banzoc-Google-Pixel-Anti-Scratch-2023/dp/B0BYZ8CF5H?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Black](https://www.amazon.com/Banzoc-Google-Pixel-Anti-Scratch-2023/dp/B0BYZ7HT3V?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Blue](https://www.amazon.com/Banzoc-Google-Pixel-Anti-Scratch-2023/dp/B0BYZ7VZDG?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), and [Red](https://www.amazon.com/Banzoc-Google-Pixel-Anti-Scratch-2023/dp/B0BYZ7XK52?tag=htg-v2-mp7903i-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893035%2Fbest-google-pixel-7a-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) color options.

### How do I clean my Pixel 7a case?

 Cleaning your case depends on the material, but for many cases, removing the case from your phone and cleaning with a slightly damp cloth is all it takes. Be careful when using disinfectants and cleaning wipes, as these could leave visible markings on some types of cases.

### Can I use my Pixel 7 or Pixel 7 Pro case with my Pixel 7a?

 No. The Pixel 7a has a different design that means it won’t properly fit into a case designed for the Pixel 7 or Pixel 7 Pro. Both are too large for the 7a.

### How much is the Google Pixel 7a?

 The Google Pixel 7a retails for $499, though you may get it for less if you can find it on sale.

### Does the Google Pixel 7a have wireless charging?

 Yes. The Google Pixel 7a features 7.5W wireless charging.
