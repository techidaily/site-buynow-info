## Ultimate Guide to Premium Desktop Displays - The 2024 Selection

###### [Read update](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/download-logitech-gaming-wheel-g29-driving-force-software-compatible-with-windows-10-11-and-7/) 

* We've reviewed our recommendations and updated our pick for the best Mac monitor.

 There's nothing quite like the extra screen real estate that a full-sized monitor provides. Even if you're used to working on a laptop, you'll be surprised how much more work can be done on a larger display.

###  UPDATE: 02/07/2024

##  What to Look For in a Computer Monitor in 2024

 There are many things to consider before you buy a monitor. This includes your budget, intended use, available space, and hardware constraints. Someone playing games competitively will have a very different set of criteria to someone who relies on full [Adobe RGB](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevate-video-popularity-12-key-strategies-unveiled/) coverage for photo editing, for example.

 You now have a lot more options for what you put on your desk than you did even a decade ago. [4K monitors](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-top-five-transformative-facebook-traits/) are more popular than ever as people buy new computers capable of driving [more than one screen at a time](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-the-required-apple-store-verification-for-iphone-8-plus-drfone-by-drfone-ios/). Opting for a [4K monitor is a great choice](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-instant-display-image-any-window-os-for-2024/) as you get a higher pixel density for sharper text and images, plus more screen real estate.

 Some options target laptop users, with many monitors now using DisplayPort or Thunderbolt-capable [USB-C connectors](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/navigating-lenovo-screen-capture-tools-effortlessly/). These can be used as a single connection point to drive the monitor and power the laptop simultaneously. This cuts down on the number of cables you need to carry or hide behind your desk, though be aware that a monitor's power output has to match your laptop's power requirements for this to work.

 If you need color accuracy (say for photo or video editing), [a calibrator is a must-buy](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-choose-the-best-android-and-ios-timers-for-your-dream-wedding/) since even a monitor that is accurately calibrated out of the box can change over time. It's also worth keeping in mind that most monitors come with sub-par speakers, so you should look at a small desktop [soundbar](https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/how-to-keep-the-conversation-flowing-on-discord/), a 2.1 system, or a good pair of [headphones.](https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/perfezionamento-dei-numeri-italiani-per-la-comunicazione-da-1-1000/) 

 In determining the best picks, we've used our discretion to ensure our recommendations are within a reasonable budget and easy to find. By tailoring our choices to the consumer market and picking only widely available models via vendors like Amazon and Best Buy, the choices below should have broad appeal to office workers, creatives, and casual gamers alike.

| Pros                                                                      | Cons                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ✓ 27-inch 4K IPS display that comes factory calibrated                    | ✗ A poor choice for gamers           |
| ✓ USB-C connectivity with power delivery                                  | ✗ 60Hz refresh rate                  |
| ✓ A good balance of image quality, accuracy, and price                    | ✗ Only 65w power delivery over USB-C |
| ✓ Ideal if you don't want to spend money on gaming features you won't use |                                      |

 It's hard to recommend a monitor that works for everyone, but the [ASUS ProArt PA279CV](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ProArt-Display-Monitor-PA279CV/dp/B08K2GFDKM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209165&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745904%2Fbest-computer-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a great place to start if you need something solid for general usage. This monitor manages to balance both features and price in a form factor that will fit on most desks. It's a 27-inch 4K display with an IPS panel featuring [Adaptive Sync VRR](https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-the-art-of-meme-craftsmanship/), though with a refresh rate of only 60Hz it's not going to wow the gamers.

 But at this price, you might not mind, especially if gaming is low on your list of priorities. The PA279CV has 100% sRGB coverage and comes factory-calibrated out of the box. The wide viewing angles offered by IPS panels make it a great choice around the office, with ergonomics that make it easy to swivel, pivot, tilt, and make height adjustments on the included stand.

 A brightness of around 350 nits in SDR content makes it great for use in well-lit rooms, though don't expect much from the HDR performance. The monitor features great connectivity including DisplayPort over [USB-C](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/navigating-lenovo-screen-capture-tools-effortlessly/), with 65w of power delivery for charging (some) laptops while you work. There's also a standard [DisplayPort](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/voicemod-malfunction-solutions-how-to-ensure-seamless-operation-in-2ts-guide/), HDMI 2.0b, and a built-in USB 3.1 hub that makes it ideal for docking your laptop with peripherals that live on your desk.

 The ProArt branding means that the PA279CV comes with ASUS' built-in presets aimed at creative professionals, offering a quick palette and preset adjustments for using the on-screen display. It's an all-rounder that offers great accuracy, plenty of screen real estate, and sharp looks at the cost of gaming-focused features.

Best Monitor Overall

#####  ASUS ProArt PA279CV

A great monitor in terms of price to features, the PA279CV is a factory-calibrated 27-inch IPS display with a 4K resolution and a 60Hz refresh rate. It features USB-C connectivity and power-delivery, plus quick color adjustment for creative work.

| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Budget-friendly 27-inch 4K monitor (163 ppi)                 | ✗ Lacks USB-C connectivity for laptop owners        |
| ✓ Great ergonomics: tilt, swivel, pivot, and height-adjustment | ✗ Limited to 60Hz makes it a poor choice for gamers |
| ✓ Nice thin bezels and a choice of colors                      | ✗ Poor peak brightness and HDR performance          |
| ✓ FreeSync capable                                             |                                                     |

 The [Dell S2721QS](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DQWG3JG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209165&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745904%2Fbest-computer-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a 27-inch budget monitor with a flat (non-curved) 4K IPS panel. This is the successor to our previous budget pick, the S2321Q. Though it shares the same technical specifications, the S2321QS has an improved stand that supports tilt, swivel, pivot, and height adjustment (the old version was limited to only tilt).

 This Dell S series monitor has the same beautiful thin bezels as its more expensive siblings, with the same 99% sRGB coverage. It lacks a USB-C connector capable of delivering power and basic display connectivity in favor of dual HDMI 2.0 ports and a [DisplayPort](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-tips-for-crafting-an-engaging-fb-timeline-memory/) 1.2 connector.

 Despite being [AMD FreeSync capable](https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-location-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/), this monitor is a poor match for gamers with its 60Hz refresh rate and 4ms response time. The [gaming monitor below](https://howto.techidaily.com/vivo-v27e-not-receiving-texts-10-hassle-free-solutions-here-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) will be a better pick (for around five times the price) or take your pick from [our best gaming monitors roundup](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/ensuring-device-compatibility-a-how-to-for-backing-up-drivers-in-windows-1110/). The S2721QS comes into its own in the office with high-quality 4K visuals and a [pixel density](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/quick-fixes-to-address-delayed-stories-on-social-networks/) of 163 ppi.

 Dell's S2721QS is a great choice for those on a budget and now features improved ergonomics, mounting options, and pre-calibrated color accuracy seen on the UltraSharp (or similarly-priced) monitors. Don't expect the same premium build quality seen on Dell's higher-end options.

| ✓ Stunning QD-OLED panel with great color and brightness                   | ✗ An expensive bit of kit                                       |
| ✓ Ultrawide aspect ratio and curved design for a more immersive experience | ✗ First of its kind                                             |
| ✓ Low latency and high refresh rates of up to 175Hz                        | ✗ Burn-in should always be a consideration with OLED technology |
| ✓ Factory calibrated, great for creatives                                  |                                                                 |

 The world's first ultrawide gaming-focused QD-OLED monitor, the curved [Dell Alienware AW3423DW](https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-AW3423DW-34-18-inch-3440x1440-Curvature/dp/B09VQ48X5Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209165&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745904%2Fbest-computer-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the best of the bunch if you have the budget to match. It features a resolution of [3440x1440](https://android-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-gps-on-android-without-mock-location-for-your-motorola-moto-g73-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/) with a refresh rate of up to 175Hz for high frame rate gaming and OLED's innate low latency.

 The real star of the show here is the QD-OLED panel, which delivers unbeatable contrast. OLED panels can switch pixels off entirely, allowing for deep blacks without the [blooming effect](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/aster-the-art-of-subtitlecc-integration-in-youtube-with-this-guide-for-2024/) that's common on backlit LED-LCD models. QD-OLED introduces some notable advancements over older WOLED technology including quantum dots for better color accuracy and higher overall luminance for better [peak brightness](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-covert-videography-the-premier-8-downloader-list/).

 That means the AW3423DW is a great choice for HDR gaming in a dark room, reaching over 1000 nits brightness on a 2% window and hovering around 250 nits in SDR content. A [curved display](https://android-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-gps-on-android-without-mock-location-for-your-motorola-moto-g73-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/) and ultrawide aspect ratio further build immersion, with a G-Sync Ultimate certification and compatibility with FreeSync for both NVIDIA and AMD-powered GPUs. You also get two HDMI ports (great for desktop console gaming) and a separate DisplayPort connector.

 If you're both a creator and a gamer, the AW3423DW won't let you down, either. The monitor comes factory calibrated and features over 99% DCI-P3 coverage. The ultrawide form factor gives you a nice big desktop to work with, and higher refresh rates mean smoother motion regardless of what you're doing (even just dragging windows around your desktop).

 The [LG 38WN95C-W](https://www.amazon.com/LG-38WN95C-W-Inch-Curved-Connectivity/dp/B0892MHG9H?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209165&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745904%2Fbest-computer-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a curved [ultrawide monitor](https://android-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-gps-on-android-without-mock-location-for-your-motorola-moto-g73-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/) with a resolution of 3840x1600, which translates to an [aspect ratio](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/e-stock-images-directly-from-trusted-4-youtube-vids/) of 21:9\. Most monitors use a 16:9 or 16:10 widescreen aspect ratio, but an ultrawide is a great option if you want more on-screen at once. An ultrawide of this screen size could replace two monitors (which makes the price a little easier to swallow) and eliminate the bezel that plagues multiple monitor setups.

 This particular LG ultrawide is packed with features, including [Thunderbolt 3 connectivity via USB-C](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-quick-conversion-tips-using-vlc-for-mpeg-4-and-beyond/) that can power a laptop with 94W of power delivery. It also hits an impressive refresh rate of 144Hz, making it buttery smooth to use on the desktop and ideal for gaming on the side, assuming your graphics card can handle it.

 The 38WN95C-W is [Nvidia G-Sync compatible](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-effortless-repetition-replay-your-youtube-videos-via-tv-connection/) and has [FreeSync Premium Pro](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-from-chats-to-files-the-methodical-approach-to-downloading-fb-video-for-2024/) on board, which means support for variable refresh rates that eliminate screen tearing in fast-paced games. A DisplayHDR 600 certification means that HDR games and movies will look good, and there's 98% coverage of DCI-P3, 100% coverage of sRGB, and a response time of 1 ms.

 In short, this ultrawide monitor is a solid all-rounder. If you want serious horizontal width at the expense of refresh rate (and your wallet), then the [Dell U4919DW](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-Marketing-Led-Lit-Monitor-U4919DW/dp/B07KMQT7DB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209165&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745904%2Fbest-computer-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an ideal super ultrawide monitor alternative that's perfect for office use.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ 32-inch 4K IPS panel with a 144Hz refresh rate                          | ✗ 32-inch may be too big for some people            |
| ✓ Great all-rounder for work and play                                     | ✗ Lower pixel density compared to smaller 4K models |
| ✓ 2 HDMI 2.1 ports                                                        | ✗ Unimpressive HDR performance                      |
| ✓ Great ergonomics on the included stand (and VESA wall mount compatible) |                                                     |

 If you're looking for a 4K monitor that can do a bit of everything, consider the [Gigabyte M32U](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083GRVFXN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209165&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745904%2Fbest-computer-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This IPS monitor features a flat 32-inch IPS panel that can hit refresh rates of 144Hz for a smooth gaming and desktop experience. Higher refresh rates and [FreeSync Premium Pro support](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-from-chats-to-files-the-methodical-approach-to-downloading-fb-video-for-2024/) make it a great choice for those who like to use their computer for work and play.

 The monitor is HDR10 capable (with a VESA HDR400 certification) but don't expect much in terms of peak brightness, topping out at around 400 nits on a 2% window. On the other hand, the relatively bright 350 nits SDR performance should work well even in well-lit rooms (great for daytime office use).

 Reviewers claim excellent color accuracy out of the box, though serious users will want to calibrate their monitor regardless. You'll get around 87% DCI-P3 coverage (and over 100% sRGB) once the monitor is set up. Connectivity-wise there are [two HDMI 2.1 ports](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-screen-mirroring-you-must-know-drfone-by-drfone-ios/), great for 120Hz 4K gaming on a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or PC.

 The monitor also features good ergonomics, with a fully adjustable stand included in the box (plus compatibility with VESA 100x100 wall mounts). The relatively understated styling and thin bezels mean it should fit in with your existing setup, and there's no sign of RGB lighting anywhere.

 This monitor is the larger version of the [Gigabyte M28U](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B094NX6C8R?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209165&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745904%2Fbest-computer-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and features a few notable advantages over its smaller sibling. It has half the response time (1 ms instead of 2 ms), the ability to swivel on the included stand, and better brightness. If the 32-inch display isn't to your tastes, the 28-inch version might be worth a look instead.

| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| ✓ 4K resolution and excellent color accuracy | ✗ No free-standing mount |
| ✓ Ergonomic, adjustable arm                  |                          |
| ✓ USB-C input supports 90W power delivery    |                          |

 The [BenQ PD2706UA](https://www.amazon.com/BenQ-PD2706UA-Rec-709-Uniformity-Calibration/dp/B0BS5Q44TF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209165&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745904%2Fbest-computer-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a fantastic monitor that'll work well for most Mac owners. This 27-inch 4K IPS monitor supports HDR10 and provides vivid, accurate colors and near-total coverage of the sRGB, Rec.709, and DCI-P3 color gamuts. What makes it the best monitor for Macs, however, is that it's officially Mac-ready, so you should have no trouble setting the monitor up with your Mac device or matching color settings.

 Additionally, the PD2706UA is equipped with an "ergo arm," which allows you to not only swivel, rotate, tilt, and adjust the monitor's height, but also move the monitor towards or away from you, or off to the side. This "ergo arm" lets you find the best viewing angle for your height to decrease unnecessary neck and shoulder pain throughout the day.

 This monitor also offers plenty of available ports, including three USB-A ports, one USB-C port for connecting peripherals and storage devices, an HDMI 2.0 port, and a USB-C port that supports 90W power delivery, which lets you run one cable between the monitor and your MacBook for video signal and charging.

 For content creators specifically, this BenQ monitor comes with a few content creation-oriented features that'll make your life easier. There's easy color profile switching, easy color profile syncing, and multiple preset modes to play with, like Animation Mode, ePaper Mode, and Darkroom Mode. You can also use the DualView feature to see content in two color modes at the same time.

 The only downside to the BenQ PD2706UA is that, because it comes with the ergo arm, there's no free-standing mount included. Most people will utilize the included ergo arm mount, but if you need a [free-standing mount](https://www.amazon.com/VIVO-Computer-Free-Standing-Adjustable-STAND-V001H/dp/B01FE2BCR8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209165&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745904%2Fbest-computer-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), you'll have to buy one separately.

## FAQ

### Can I use a TV as a computer monitor?

 Nothing stops you from using a TV as a computer monitor if you have an HDMI output (or adapter) to work with. There may be issues in doing this, however, since TVs are designed to be used much further away, and are less geared toward rendering crisp text compared with computer monitors. If you're considering using a TV, make sure you can put enough distance between yourself and the display to avoid eye strain.

### Can I use the computer monitor as a TV?

 A computer monitor is not designed to be used as a standalone device, unlike a TV. A TV has a tuner, a separate operating system, and apps. A monitor is just a display that requires a source device to be of any use. You may be able to use a monitor like a TV by plugging in a streaming device like a Chromecast or Apple TV, or simply using your computer to stream content from services like YouTube or Netflix. You should also be aware that not all monitors include speakers, and even those that do are often poor.

### How do I connect two monitors to one computer?

 Not all computers will support dual monitors, but many do. You can check whether your laptop or GPU supports two (or more) monitors by consulting the manufacturer's website If you have two outputs on your computer's GPU, you can try connecting each monitor to a separate output. Many laptops will have video output (like an HDMI port) for connecting an external monitor, while others will support additional monitors through a USB hub with a DisplayPort or HDMI output.

### Do computer monitors have speakers?

 Most computer monitors include speakers, but not all. These are generally low-powered and deliver poor sound quality, so should not be relied upon for serious usage. You're better off connecting a pair of [decent desktop speakers](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-synergizing-visual-cues-with-the-right-musical-choices/) or investing in [a good pair of headphones](https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/perfezionamento-dei-numeri-italiani-per-la-comunicazione-da-1-1000/) instead.

### How do I clean my computer monitor?

 You should clean your monitor carefully using a soft microfiber cloth. Consult manufacturer directions and avoid any harsh cleaning chemicals. If you're struggling with stubborn grime, moisten a cloth with distilled water and use it to spot clean problem areas. For more information, see [our full guide to cleaning your TV or monitor](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-top-10-capture-cards-for-youtube-you-should-know/).

### How do I dispose of my old computer monitors?

 If your old monitor is in working order, consider selling it on a classified website like Facebook Marketplace to someone who needs it.
