## Sony's Latest Bargain: Get the PS5 Slim and Spider-Man 2 Bundle for Its Most Affordable Price Ever!

Countless PS5 deals and discounts were available during Black Friday and the holidays. If you missed out, now you can get the newer PS5 Slim _Spider-Man 2_ bundle for the lowest price we've seen yet, only $449.

 If you've been debating whether you [should upgrade to the PS5 Slim](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-from-hobbies-to-hearts-youtubes-path-to-fame/), this deal might make you think twice. [Best Buy is now](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-playstation-5-slim-console-marvels-spider-man-2-bundle-full-game-download-included-white%2F6565065.p%3FskuId%3D6565065) offering the PS5 Slim with a digital copy of _Spider-Man 2_ for only $449 ($50 off), which is a great price as the new bundle's first discount.

 We saw the regular PlayStation 5 drop to $499 late last year, then again a few weeks ago, but this deal drops the price even further while getting you the latest PS5 console at the same time. And for anyone who's seen the original PS5, it's enormous, so this is a welcome change.

 While the new "Slim" model still has the same general design and shape, it's about 30% smaller and quite a bit lighter than the previous disc and discless versions. It doesn't come with a vertical stand in the box anymore, and if you still want one, it'll be another $30\. The Slim comes with two front-facing USB-C ports, 1TB of storage, and more. Either way, you're getting the latest and greatest alongside a much-anticipated game, all for only $449.
