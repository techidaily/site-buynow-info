 _We purchased the AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review._

 Buyers searching for a USB hub to open up the connectivity options on their desktop or laptop are likely to stumble across the AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub. This hub is part of a suite of hubs that Amazon offers under the AmazonBasics brand, ranging from four-port to 10-port options. With this particular, 7-port flavor of their hubs, you get five regular USB 3.0 ports, and two fast-charge ports, capable of supplying more power.

 The AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub definitely offers a lot of bang for your buck, but we have some quality control qualms that prevent this from being an instant recommendation. If you're on a budget and you need a lot of[USB ports](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166) , you might still want to consider this option, but let’s dig into the details before you make your purchase.

## **Design: A clean look, with some awkward ports**

 Measuring 5.7 x 2.6 x 1.1 inches (HWD), the AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub is not a particularly petite or compact device, but it does do itself some favors in the design department. The slanted body contains two connections on its left, one for the power and one for the USB-B port. On the back, you’ll find five standard USB 3.0 Type-A ports. The right side contains two fast-charge ports capable of supplying more than the standard power, so long as you’ve connected the hub to an outlet using the power cable. Finally, the top contains a simple blue LED, which lit up as soon as we connected the USB cable to the computer.

 This design makes it a little awkward to connect your devices to it initially, but ultimately gives your desk a much cleaner look, and lets you drape your cables off the back of your desk, minimizing eyesores.

 This design makes it a little awkward to connect your devices to it initially, but ultimately gives your desk a much cleaner look, and lets you drape your cables off the back of your desk, minimizing eyesores.

 Plastic is used throughout the hub for its construction, including the front plate, which is designed to resemble brushed metal. This keeps the unit very light, which we’re sure is good for shipping purposes, but it also makes it feel a bit cheap and makes it easier to slide accidentally off your desk.

 There were two quality control mishaps on the particular unit we tested. First, the internal ports were somewhat misaligned with the outer casing, making it difficult to plug in some devices. Second, the labels that should be printed around the ports didn’t make it onto this particular unit, despite all the product page images showing this feature. Not a huge deal, but also not a ringing endorsement for the device’s quality.

## **Setup Process: No trouble at all**

 To begin using the AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub, remove the main hub from its packaging and connect the supplied USB (A-to-B) cable to both the hub and your computer. Then connect the power source to an outlet. That should be all you need. If you encounter any issues, Amazon provides some basic troubleshooting steps in the manual.

 The AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub is an otherwise capable device that is unfortunately marred by quality control issues and cheap construction.

## **Connectivity: A sufficient number of options**

 The AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub comes with a three-foot USB (A-to\_B) cable to connect to your computer. This should be sufficient for most users, and worked well in our setup. An AC power adapter is included as well, and it comes with a fairly substantial power brick.

 The hub provides seven USB 3.0 Gen 1 ports, offering a maximum transfer speed of 5Gbps. The two ports on the right side offer the same connectivity, but are capable of supplying more power.

## **Performance: Just what you’d expect**

 The AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub performed as expected in our tests, providing USB 3.0 Gen 1 speeds. The five ports in the back supply the standard 0.9A of power, whereas the ports on the side, designed for fast charging, can supply up to 1.5A. If you neglect to connect the hub to a power source, the entire device will have to share the 0.9A of power supplied by your computer’s[USB 3.0 port](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-usb-3-0-2626038) .

 The five ports in the back supply the standard 0.9A of power, whereas the ports on the side, designed for fast charging, can supply up to 1.5A.

## **Price: You get what you pay for**

 At a list price of $33.44, the AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub isn’t a terrible deal, but given the materials used and the quality control issues, it’s definitely not an amazing deal. Buyers looking for a bit more might consider AUKEY’s 10-port powered hub or Amazon’s own AmazonBasics 10 Ports USB 3.0 Charging Hub Docking Station. Both these hubs offer more connections and dedicated power.

## **AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub vs. Aukey USB Hub 3.0**

 Those looking for a more compact device, or perhaps those more concerned with appearance and build quality, might consider Aukey’s 4-port USB 3.0 hub. This hub lacks the dedicated power that Amazon’s offering has, but comes at around half the price. Additionally, AUKEY’s hub has significantly better materials and build quality than Amazon’s plasticky device. Ultimately, the features that you need in your device will guide your purchase, but these are the considerations we think buyers should think about.

 Take a peek at some of the other[best USB hubs](https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-hubs-4142295) you can buy.

 Final Verdict

**A capable hub with some quality control issues.**

 The AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub is an otherwise capable device that is unfortunately marred by quality control issues and cheap construction. That said, if you don’t care as much about design and construction quality, it might still be a good affordable option.
