##  How to Shop for a New Lightning Cable in 2023

 Shopping for a new Lightning cable sounds easy. After all, the principal philosophy is often just finding a wire with a Lightning connector on one end and some type of connector on the other. That's usually good enough for some, but there are some important factors to keep in mind.

 For one, not every Lightning cable is created equally. While they all share similarities, some use cheaper parts than others and can wear down over time more quickly. In addition, some will only last so long before they shrug their shoulders and decide to stop working one day. You don't want that, which is why it's always best to buy from well-established and trustworthy brands that use quality materials like nylon to protect their cables.

 It's also important to shop for a Lightning cable with the right connector. You'll want to make sure the cable you buy can connect to the power adapters you own, regardless of end quality. Some have the more recent USB-C connector on their opposite end, while others have an older USB-A connection. You may need another type of connector entirely, such as HDMI or AUX.

 Finally, consider exactly what kind of Lightning cable you want. Do you need a super long one? How about one that can let you connect to an external monitor? Want an all-in-one cable that can charge every device in your bag, including your iPhone? Planning ahead will make sure you're not disappointed in the future.

 It is worth remembering that Apple has moved away from using a Lightning port in favor of USB-C on the iPhone 15\. This change has been happening with MacBooks and iPads for a few years, so if you are planning on upgrading your Apple device soon, a cable with a Lightning connector might not be the most cost-effective long-term option.

 Below, we've rounded up the best Lightning cable to get based on your budget, needs, and preferences.

| Pros                        | Cons                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Durable nylon design        | Price is a bit steep |
| Versatile length            |                      |
| USB-C and MFi certification |                      |

 Our pick for the best Lightning cable you can get is [Anker's USB-C to Lightning Charging Cord](https://www.amazon.com/Lightning-Anker-Charging-Certified-Supports/dp/B07XYY6Q34?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208150&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764404%2Fbest-lightning-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It's covered in a durable nylon finish with aluminum-housed Lightning and USB connectors.

 The cable supports Power Delivery for optimal charging performance and is [Made for iPhone](https://mfi.apple.com/) certified. It's also a terrific length at six feet and is available in three colors. USB-C is the standard for most power bricks as well, so this Lightning cable will be compatible with the best chargers and power bricks.

 Anker's cable is a bit pricey, but it's well worth it for a cable that'll undoubtedly last you a long time without fraying.

#####  Anker New Nylon USB-C to Lightning Charging Cable

Anker's USB-C to Lightning nylon cable is a terrific option if all you need is a good, all-around charger for your iPhone and iPad.

##  Best Budget Lightning Cable: [SMALLElectric 6-ft Lightning Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Certified-iPhone-Charger-Lightning/dp/B0829ZBTNM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208150&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764404%2Fbest-lightning-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                            | Cons                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Pack of two 6-foot-long cables  | Outdated USB-A connector |
| Nylon-braided coating           |                          |
| Aluminum alloy connector casing |                          |

 If you need a Lightning cable that does the job but doesn't cost an arm and a leg, this [SMALLElectric 6-ft Lightning Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Certified-iPhone-Charger-Lightning/dp/B0829ZBTNM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208150&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764404%2Fbest-lightning-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) fits the bill. It probably won't last for 10 years of heavy use, but if you are on a tight budget, it's hard to beat.

 For its affordable price tag, you get two 6-foot-long cables. They have a nylon braided coating and aluminum alloy connectors for durability. Sadly, USB-A has been used instead of USB-C, but you can't expect too much for cables that are less than five dollars apiece.

 It is, however, [Made For iPhone](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/reality-beyond-exploring-vrs-contemporary-state-and-implications-for-2024/) (MFi) certified and has been tested to withstand 40,000 bends. If you are looking for a good value Lightning cable to connect your iPhone or iPad to your computer or USB-A wall charger, this will do the job.

| Pros                                            | Cons   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 10-foot length                                  | Costly |
| Very durable design, with a leather belt        |        |
| USB-C with Power Delivery and MFi certification |        |

 Sometimes you just need a really long Lightning cable, and for that scenario, we recommend picking up the [Native Union Belt Cable XL](https://www.amazon.com/Native-Union-Belt-Cable-Ultra-Strong/dp/B082TZ7ZCQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208150&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764404%2Fbest-lightning-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This USB-C to Lightning cord is 10 feet in length, so you'll have plenty of flexibility, and any extra cord can be wrapped up with a pre-attached leather belt. It's available in a decent amount of colors and finishes, too.

 The best part about this cable is its durability. It's coated in a nylon finish like many other cables, but what makes it unique is its ultra-strong reinforced structure that can withstand 2x more stress and last up to 6x as long as normal Lightning cables.

 Admittedly, this cord is a bit costly. For the price, however, you do get a very robust Lightning cable for Apple devices that'll last you a long time.

| Made for iPhone-certified |                                |

 For those who need a shorter, more basic Lightning cable, check out the [Anker Powerline II](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H27J698?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208150&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764404%2Fbest-lightning-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It's Made for iPhone-certified and supports Power Delivery for fast charging your iPhone. It's three feet in length, which, while short, still offers enough cord to not be inconveniently short. It also has a USB-C connector.

 While it's not as durable as other Lightning cables with its rubber finish, there's no question that this is a solid option if what you need is a short Lightning cable that doesn't skimp on features.

| Durable braided nylon design                         |                                      |
| Made for iPhone certified with fast charging support |                                      |

 If you're a long-time iPhone user, you probably have a few spare USB-C to Lightning cables lying around or stuffed into a drawer. That might not be the case for USB-A to Lightning cables. USB-A to Lightning probably isn't something you will use every day, but when you do need it, it makes sense to use a good one.

 The [Belkin BoostCharge](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Lightning-MFi-Certified-Charging-CAA002bt2MBK/dp/B086H39P8S?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208150&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764404%2Fbest-lightning-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is just such a cable. It has been tested and certified to withstand 10,000 bends before splitting or breaking, so it should last a good while.

 Belkin is generally a good and well-respected brand, and this cable is MFi-certified and supports fast charging. Unless you are dead set on only buying Apple accessories at inflated prices, it's well worth a look.

 The ability to connect through Bluetooth has largely removed the need to carry an AUX cable around, but in some situations, a wired connection still makes better sense. With that in mind, the [UGREEN AUX Cord for iPhone](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Lightning-Certified-3-5-Headphone-Adapter/dp/B07VD5KBMP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208150&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764404%2Fbest-lightning-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a well-made and reliable option for connecting your Apple device to a speaker, headphones, or other audio accessory. 

 Available in 3.3 and 6.6ft lengths, the cord has a braided nylon outer to help ensure it can withstand plenty of use. It has been tested to withstand 15000 bends, which is a pretty impressive number. Added to that, both the AUX and Lightning connectors are housed within aluminum cases, which offer good protection from damage and also help to dissipate heat. 

 This isn't the cheapest AUX to Lightning cable you can buy, but if you want something built to last and that has MFi certification, the slightly higher price will be money well spent.
