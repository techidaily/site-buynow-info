## Exploring Video Games: Understanding the Differences Between Metroidvania and Search-Action Blends

### Key Takeaways

* Metroidvania games reward progression and exploration with new abilities and upgrades to access more of the map.
* The genre originated with Metroid and Castlevania, evolving to include indie hits like Cave Story and Axiom Verge.
* Modern Metroidvania titles, such as Dead Cells and Ori series provide a range of takes on the genre that blend different genres and provide accessible and unique entry points to the genre.

 The “Metroidvania” genre can be hard to wrap your head around if you’re not familiar with the _Metroid_ or _Castlevania_ franchises. To further muddy the waters, the genre has a completely different name in Japan. But these games are worthy of your time considering the ways in which they reward progression and exploration.

##  What Is a Metroidvania or Search-Action Game?

 The term Metroidvania is a portmanteau of _Metroid_ and _Castlevania_, two games that ultimately defined the genre. Nintendo’s _Metroid_ saw its first release in August 1986, while _Castlevania_ made its debut in September of the same year.

 The original games take the form of action-adventure platformers with large interconnected levels, an often complex world map, and a gradual upgrade system. Perhaps the most defining characteristic is the way that players gain new abilities, items, or means of accessing new parts of the map as they proceed through the game.

_Metroid: Dread_

 For example, when starting a _Metroidvania_ game, you will likely encounter inaccessible doors, switches that you can’t use, ledges that you can’t reach, and more right from the outset. Over time, you will unlock ways to access these areas either through tools or skills, which often lead to even more upgrades that you can use to fully explore the map. This drip-feed of progressive exploration is one of the most satisfying aspects of modern gaming.

 As a result, these games can often require a fair bit of backtracking or warping which is why a detailed map becomes such a valuable resource. Like any genre, not every game that falls within this categorization rigidly adheres to the rules. As such, the lines have become blurred as more games take inspiration from the genre or bend it into something different entirely.

 In Japan, this type of game is known as a “Search-Action” game (Tansaku-Gata Akushon). This is likely because _Metroid_ didn’t experience the same level of success there as it did in the West, and because _Castlevania_ is known as _Akumajō Dracula_ in Japan.

##  The Evolution of _Metroid_ and _Castlevania_ 

 After _Metroid_ and _Castlevania_ debuted in 1986, both franchises saw success with the release of further entries. _Super Metroid_ became an SNES hit in 1994, taking advantage of the system’s increased power with improved visuals. It further encouraged exploration with secret areas, varied biomes, and a more compelling narrative.

_Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_ is regarded by many as the franchise’s best outing, arriving on PlayStation in 1997\. The game incorporated role-playing elements like a character upgrade system on top of other genre staples like an interconnected world and incremental upgrades.

_Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_

_Metroid_ eventually made the move to the 3D realm with the arrival of the _Metroid Prime_ series, which blends first-person shooting with more traditional Metroidvania elements. Nintendo’s most recent 2D _Metroid_ outing was 2021’s _Metroid: Dread_ for Nintendo Switch, a follow-up that received widespread praise from fans of the series and critics alike.

 Koji Igarashi, the writer and programmer of _Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_, left Konami in 2014 and responded to fan requests for more of the same with _Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night_. This spiritual successor to the best of the _Castlevania_ series proved to be a hit, with additional content released as late as 2024, with a sequel in the works.

 But there’s way more to the genre than namesakes and spiritual spin-offs. Indie development studios in particular have picked up the torch and made valuable contributions, like 2004’s _Cave Story_ which was developed by a single Japanese developer (Daiksuke Amaya) in his free time, before becoming a cult classic with an accessible modern Nintendo Switch port.

_Axiom Verge_ is another similar Metroidvania that started as a side project by developer Thomas Happ. Like _Cave Story_, the game is considered an indie masterpiece by many and has gone on to receive a sequel. The game takes a lot of inspiration from _Metroid_, tasking the player with exploration of an alien planet through the use of power-ups and upgrades.

_Axiom Verge_

 The _Ori_ series is another fan-favorite Metroidvania platformer, with a more approachable difficulty curve and beautiful visuals. _Hollow Knight_ is another beloved title that takes inspiration from _Metroid_, _Zelda_, and _Mega Man_ that saw its development funded by a Kickstarter campaign. The follow-up, _Hollow Knight: Silksong_ is one of the most eagerly awaited games of all time.

 And then there are the outliers, like _Yoku’s Island Express_, which is part pinball game and part platformer, with a strong emphasis on Metroidvania elements like exploration and unlocks. _Steamworld Dig_ (and its sequel) incorporate one of the most satisfying gameplay loops of exploration, mining, and ever-improving equipment that’s so good it’s hard to put down.

 But perhaps the best example of a modern _Metroidvania_ is _Dead Cells_, a game that blends the best parts of a roguelike game with the exploration and permanent unlocks of a Metroidvania. Like other roguelikes, the game is run-based, and when you die you lose all of your items and upgrades while still making progress by unlocking Runes and spending an in-game currency on consumables called Cells.

##  Where Should You Start?

 If you’ve never played a Metroidvania before, many of the games mentioned above are good starting points. Perhaps the two most obvious choices though are _Super Metroid_ (available on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System with a Nintendo Switch Online membership) and _Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_ (available on PS4 and playable on PS5).

_Steamworld Dig 2_ is worthy of your time if you’re put off by the difficulty of some Metroidvania titles, and you can finish it in a few hours. _Guacamelee!_ is another approachable title that embraces Mexican folklore and accessible combat to great effect.

_Steamworld Dig 2_

 For a step up in difficulty and a chance to be wowed by an endearing story and jaw-dropping art direction, _Ori and the Blind Forest_ and its sequel _Ori and the Will of the Wisps_ are challenging but fair jumping-on points. The same could be said of _Hollow Knight_, though the game dials up the difficulty with its bosses.

 If you’re not scared of a challenge, _Metroid: Dread_ is a true modern 2D take on the genre. Be warned though, the use of the word “dread” in the title is not to be taken lightly (I never did finish the final boss). _Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night_ is a similarly modern take on 2D Search-Action, albeit in a more fantastical setting rather than a sci-fi one. Another modern 2D Metroidvania is _Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown_, which even includes an “easy” difficulty setting for those who need it.

_Dead Cells_

 And even if you are put off by the [Soulslike](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-tutorial-uploading-youtube-to-instagram-stories-effortlessly/) combat and fast pace, _Dead Cells_ is a masterpiece of game design that feels oh-so-satisfying to play, even if you are making progress at a glacial pace.

 If you’ve got a [modern portable console like the Nintendo Switch](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/brother-mfc-l2740dw-11-drivers-free-windows-downloads-compatible-with-various-versions-of-microsoft-os/) or Valve’s [Steam Deck handheld gaming PC](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-utilizing-internal-screen-recording-on-huaweis-mate-1020-and-p-models-p20-p10/), these types of games are especially well-suited to handheld play. They work well in short bursts, rely on relatively simple control schemes, and many of them have system requirements that won’t stress your battery too much. The older titles are also ripe for emulation, [something the Steam Deck does very well](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-life360-circle-everything-you-need-to-know-on-realme-11-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).
