## Challenging the Future: Will There Be a Successor to Sony's Classic Handheld PlayStation?

### Key Takeaways

* The success of the PlayStation Portal illustrates the potential of remote play functionality in place of dedicated handheld gaming hardware.
* Rather than having a traditional handheld console like the PlayStation Vita, many gamers just want a way to conveniently take their PS5 games to other rooms in the home.
* The quality and convenience of smartphone gaming makes it even less likely that Sony will spend the time and money on a PS Vita follow-up.

 Sony's latest attempt at handheld gaming, the PlayStation Portal, falls short of being a "proper" portable console because it cannot run games natively. Considering the success of this device and the growing popularity of remote-play devices, I'm doubtful that we'll see another "proper" handheld PlayStation again.

##  The PlayStation Portal Has Widespread Appeal

 The PlayStation Portal is a [handheld accessory that connects to your PlayStation 5 console over Wi-Fi](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-webcam-master-ultimate-live-recording-guide/) if the PS5 itself is powered on or in rest mode. The Portal is optimized specifically for this remote play functionality, so it offers a relatively seamless experience of switching between console play and handheld play.

 The announcement of the PlayStation Portal in 2023 was met with some uncertainty regarding the need for such a device. However, gaming industry analyst Mat Piscatella [highlighted](https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810379504218681666?ref%5Fsrc=twsrc%5Etfw) the findings from a report indicating that, as of May 2024, the PlayStation Portal was the best-selling video game accessory year-to-date.

 The recent success of the PlayStation Portal now shows that there is a widespread demand for remote-play devices, which console manufacturers can capitalize on again in the future instead of a traditional or [retro-style gaming handheld](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/quick-route-to-your-latest-fb-video-viewings-for-2024/).

 This could also mean that the PS5 might see future games that are well-suited to mobile gaming but with a level of quality and production closer to a console game, to please the growing remote-play audience. The PS5 is already home to several mobile-friendly games, like _Honkai: Star Rail_ and _Diablo IV_, that are conducive to playing in short bursts while on the go with a device like the Portal.

##  There Is a Growing "Handheld at Home" Crowd

 Using the PlayStation Portal requires a stable Wi-Fi connection and a [capable Wi-Fi router](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-discovering-the-ultimate-10-free-youtube-artist-collaborators-for-2024/) so you can stream the gameplay of your PS5 system to the device in your hands. This limits the places you can actually use the Portal.

 While you can certainly use it to play your PS5 games from a hotel room or coffee shop by [navigating public Wi-Fi login pages](https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-pioneer-bdr-xd05b-blu-ray-drive-assessment-identifying-key-flaws/), for example, many people simply enjoy using the Portal while lounging in bed or when a family member is using the TV. A large number of Portal adopters just want to carry the PS5 experience with them to other places in the house.

 Other devices like the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck are contributing to the growth of this "handheld at home" trend in which gamers are actively [choosing to use portable devices to enjoy console-quality gaming](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-utilizing-internal-screen-recording-on-huaweis-mate-1020-and-p-models-p20-p10/) even when they aren't leaving the house. There is little demand for dedicated handheld gaming hardware akin to the old PlayStation Vita when remote-play users can just pick up a device like the Portal to continue their PS5 gaming when they step into another room or hop on the treadmill.

##  Modern Phones Do the Job Just as Well

 In a time when most people have the option to pursue high-quality [smartphone gaming](https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-strategy-to-correct-mw3-dev-error-6068-as-you-head-into-2024/) with their current devices, console manufacturers recognize that releasing a gaming handle that only plays games is redundant.

 The PlayStation Portal may have found success for its ability to deliver a superior handheld gaming experience by focusing entirely on remote play functionality, but you can get a similar result with most phones and tablets by using a remote play app and [the PS5 is no exception](https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/in-2024-import-songs-into-adobe-premiere-cc-for-soundtracking/).

Apple

 Whether you [use a remote play phone app](https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/in-2024-import-songs-into-adobe-premiere-cc-for-soundtracking/) or a dedicated remote play device like the Portal, you are likely to get a higher quality gaming experience compared to what a traditional handheld console limited by its own hardware could deliver.

 While some gamers like myself might wax nostalgic about classic handhelds such as the PlayStation Vita or Nintendo DS, cloud gaming and remote play technology give great cause for doubt that those types of portable consoles will ever make a comeback outside of niche cases like the [Playdate](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-rev-voice-recorder-download-and-review/).

 Just because Sony has put all of its portable eggs in one basket, doesn't mean other hardware manufacturers will follow suit. Handheld gaming PCs like the [Steam Deck are more popular than ever](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unifying-streams-simultaneous-capture-of-camplusscreen/), with [new revisions like the Rog Ally X](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-the-insiders-guide-to-creating-stunning-iphone-hdr-photos/) arriving all of the time. It's a great time for handheld gaming, especially when you can [get a foot in the door for under $100](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/fixing-laptop-audio-issues-a-step-by-step-guide-to-restoring-internal-speaker-functionality/).
