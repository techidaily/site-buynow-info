##  What to Look For in Computer Speakers in 2024

 The first thing to remember when shopping for computer speakers is what you're going to be using them for. Most speakers will work fine for Zoom calls and YouTube videos, but you will require something better if you're an audiophile or creative professional.

 If you're buying speakers for a gaming PC, there are a few extra factors to remember. Directional audio is important, so you'll want speakers with a strong stereo image. We've got [a specific pick for gaming speakers](https://common-error.techidaily.com/quick-remedies-to-address-missing-bluetooth-on-your-windows-11-system/), but many other picks on this list will work, especially if they have a subwoofer.

 Not everyone needs a [subwoofer](https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-non-functional-audio-devices-on-windows-7-systems/), especially if you only watch the occasional video. However, gamers and music fans will surely enjoy the enhanced bass frequencies that a subwoofer brings to the table.

 Size is also a major consideration with speakers. Smaller-sized ones can fit anywhere, but won't always sound as good as larger speakers. Keep this in mind for subwoofers too, as they can range from relatively tiny to the size of a typical large subwoofer, depending on the speakers you choose. If you want great audio, you'll want space on your desk for bigger computer speakers.

 Finally, you need to consider how you're going to plug your speakers in. Many speakers use a standard 3.5 mm jack that plugs into either the headphone output or auxiliary output on your computer. That said, more and more speakers are using a single USB-A or USB-C cable to connect to your computer.

 Bluetooth is an increasingly popular option in computer speakers if you'd rather connect wirelessly. We've got a recommendation for the [best Bluetooth speakers](https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-tone-generation-made-simple-5-top-online-options/), but many other speakers we're looking at also feature Bluetooth.

 Now that you've figured out what you're looking for, here are the best computer speakers you can buy.

| Pros                                       | Cons                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| ✓ Great sound for the small size           | ✗ Subwoofer sold separately |
| ✓ Small footprint takes minimal desk space |                             |
| ✓ Bluetooth built-in                       |                             |

 Looking at the [Audioengine A2+](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MYV2527?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), you might mistake them for a larger set of speakers than they actually are, as they look like they belong in your home theater setup. Don't let the smaller size fool you, however---these speakers pack some serious sound quality, regardless of their physical size.

 The Audioengine A2+ speakers have a tiny footprint, with each speaker only measuring 6×4×5.25 inches, but they're more powerful than meets the eye. These speakers pack 60 watts of class A/B power into 2.75-inch aramid fiber drivers and 0.75-inch silk dome tweeters.

 These speakers aim to bring the high-quality audio Audioengine's larger speakers are known for into a smaller format, and they achieve impressive results. Even the bass is impressive for the size, though if you feel like you need more, you can easily pair these with the [Audioengine S6 subwoofer](https://www.amazon.com/Audioengine-Compact-Powered-Subwoofer-Powerful/dp/B09Q4GYPM5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 No matter how you want to connect the Audioengine A2+ speakers to your computer, you can probably do it. In addition to a digital USB connection, you can connect analog audio via the 3.5 mm input jack or via the RCA inputs on the back of the speaker.

 If you'd rather connect digitally, you can opt for Bluetooth, with the aptX codec ensuring high-quality sound. You can also opt to plug your speakers into your computer and use Bluetooth to stream music from your phone when you want to kick back and relax.

 The Audioengine A2+ comes in the standard black finish, but if you prefer more color, it's also available in [red](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P5PTP32?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [white](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MYW4Q8S?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) varieties.

| ✓ Clear Dialog feature makes voices easier to hear | ✗ No subwoofer means bass may be weak |
| ✓ USB or 3.5mm connectivity                        |                                       |
| ✓ Unique shape looks nice on your desk             |                                       |

 If you're just plugging in your laptop at your desk or prefer a minimalist desktop, the [Creative Pebble V3](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Minimalistic-Enhancement-Bluetooth-Converter/dp/B08F57GSJ7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a great option. The fact that they also happen to be affordable is a nice bonus.

 These little wonders provide 8 watts of consistent RMS power, with a peak output of 16 watts. This power flows to the 2.25-inch driver in each speaker, which is larger than the V2\. Combined with the power, Creative claims on its Amazon page that the Pebble V3 is twice as loud as [the previous version](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Pebble-Minimalistic-AUX-Type/dp/B07VVP8BGD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 If you're going for a minimal setup, the easiest way to plug in the Creative Pebble V3 is USB-C. Don't worry if you've got an older PC or laptop, though, as Creative has included a USB-A adapter to ensure you can use these speakers, regardless of what kind of computer you have.

 Do you prefer a more traditional connection? No problem, you can plug the Pebble V3 in with an included 3.5 mm speaker cable. If you prefer not to use wires at all, you can also connect via [Bluetooth 5](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-copyright-aware-techniques-for-reposting-imagery/).

 The Pebble speakers use a unique 45-degree elevated driver. This helps get the sound from the tiny speakers more directly to your ears. The Pebble V3 also includes Clear Dialog audio processing to make sure that voices come through loud and clear.

 Again, we're looking at the standard black model here, which is the more common version. If you'd rather your speakers stick out, you can also opt for the [white version](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Minimalistic-Enhancement-Bluetooth-Converter/dp/B09F9GTKL8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

The Pebble V3 is the best version of Creative's popular speaker yet, with more volume, more connectivity options, and processing that makes hearing voices in videos easier.

| Pros                                   | Cons                  |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| ✓ 5-inch drivers for full-range sound  | ✗ No USB connectivity |
| ✓ Rear bass ports offer improved bass  |                       |
| ✓ Multiple nice looking finish options |                       |

 If you live for music, most plain old computer speakers aren't going to cut it. Sure, they'll let you hear the music, but you certainly won't hear it at its best. The [Fluance Ai41](https://www.amazon.com/Fluance-Bookshelf-Amplifier-Turntable-Bluetooth/dp/B094YXTSFD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) speakers, on the other hand, take the convenience of computer speakers and combine it with the sound and aesthetic of bookshelf speakers.

 Unlike most of the speakers we're looking at, these are full-size, with the dual internal [class D amplifiers](https://android-location.techidaily.com/9-best-free-android-monitoring-apps-to-monitor-phone-remotely-for-your-oppo-reno-11-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/) pushing 45 watts of power per speaker into the 5-inch glass fiber composite drivers. The speakers use a pair of neodymium silk-dome tweeters for clean, airy-sounding highs.

 The speakers sit inside MDF cabinets that are internally braced to prevent unwanted vibration that can interfere with the sound. While these speakers include a connection for a subwoofer, you might not need it. The Fluance Ai41 speakers have rear bass ports for enhanced low end, and they work quite well.

 For connectivity, you've got multiple options, though you won't find a 3.5-inch jack for a standard computer plugin. Instead, you'll need a [3.5mm to RCA adapter](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-3-5mm-2-Male-Adapter-Stereo/dp/B01D5H8KO2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to plug into the RCA inputs on the rear of the speaker. Alternately, you use the optical [TOSLINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOSLINK) digital input to connect to your computer.

 Unlike the larger [Ai61 model](https://www.amazon.com/Fluance-Bookshelf-Amplifier-Turntable-Bluetooth/dp/B094YXPRKR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), the Ai41 doesn't feature USB connectivity, but they do feature Bluetooth 5\. This isn't going to give you quite the same audio fidelity as either of the physical connections will. That said, it's still nice to have it if you or a friend wants to play a few songs from a streaming music service.

 We're looking at the Black Ash option here, but the Fluance Ai41 is also available in [Lucky Bamboo](https://www.amazon.com/Fluance-Bookshelf-Amplifier-Turntable-Bluetooth/dp/B094YVQ3W1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Natural Walnut](https://www.amazon.com/Fluance-Bookshelf-Amplifier-Turntable-Bluetooth/dp/B094YYYFRM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [White Walnut](https://www.amazon.com/Fluance-Bookshelf-Amplifier-Turntable-Bluetooth/dp/B094YXHPCQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) finish options.

| Pros                                                      | Cons                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ The subwoofer delivers powerful and clean bass          | ✗ A tad overpriced                                       |
| ✓ Sound quality is fantastic                              | ✗ The Ambient Awareness mode is a letdown                |
| ✓ Bright and vivid RGB when using one of the preset modes | ✗ Razer Synapse is a buggy and bloated piece of software |
| ✓ THX spatial audio works great in games                  |                                                          |

 The [Razer Nommo V2](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Nommo-Pro-Projection-Down-Firing/dp/B0C2XR4CC2?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is Razer's latest foray into 2.1 computer speaker systems, and the end result is one of the best PC speaker systems on the market for gaming and mixed-use. 

 Firstly, the sound this system delivers is superb. The two full-range, 3.2-inch drivers provide a rich sound with clean mids and highs, and while the 5.5-inch subwoofer delivers quality lows and lots of them, the bass tends to overpower the rest of the sound spectrum at lower volumes. This doesn’t hurt the gaming experience—if anything, it's welcome—but the bassy output won’t be to everyone’s preference when listening to music. 

 The Razer Nommo V2 also features THX [spatial audio](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-pattern-locks-are-unsafe-secure-your-samsung-galaxy-a14-5g-phone-now-with-these-tips-by-drfone-android/) that works great in games. That said, I recommend turning it off and relying on stereo output when not gaming, because the spatial sound can distort music and video content. As for the RGB on the back, it’s bright and vivid when you’re using one of the presets, but the Ambient Awareness mode that reflects the content shown on your monitor is quite dim with tepid-looking colors. This is a disappointment considering the ambient RGB mode is one of the biggest selling points of the Nommo V2\. 

 Regarding connectivity and controls, you’re getting volume controls on the right satellite, USB, and Bluetooth connectivity, with most extra features, including THX and RGB presets available in Ryzen Synapse. Differences to the [Nommo V2 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Nommo-Pro-Projection-Down-Firing/dp/B0C2Y8JYCZ?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) include a wired subwoofer instead of a wireless one and the absence of the wireless control puck for $150\. That's more than a fair trade, especially since you can [buy the control puck](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU205886&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-headsets-and-audio-accessories%2Frazer-wireless-control-pod%2FRC30-474C0100-R3U1) for $50.

 When it comes to the negatives, aside from the disappointing ambiance mode and high price, the satellites are mounted on an angled base that doesn’t include any adjustments, and Razer Synapse is filled with small bugs and is generally a bloated piece of software. If you want a notably better RGB ambiance mode in games, check out the [Logitech G560](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-LIGHTSYNC-Gaming-Speakers-Lighting/dp/B07B2WLS17?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). For $100 less, you’re not getting the same level of sound quality, but the G560 is well-suited for gaming audio. There’s also the famous [Klipsch ProMedia 2.1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000062VUO/ref=aod%5Frecs%5Fdesktop%5Fprsubs%5F2?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This system doesn’t pack RGB but costs only about $120 and offers impressive sound quality for the price.

 If you're not a fan of wires and just looking for a simple speaker system to use with your computer, the [Logitech Z407 Bluetooth Computer Speakers](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Bluetooth-Computer-Subwoofer-Immersive/dp/B0877BPCJM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) are a fantastic option. These aren't packed with bells and whistles, but they're a modernized take on the classic computer speaker.

 This is a 2.1-channel speaker system with two stereo speakers and an included subwoofer. All of these together are capable of 40 watts of constant power, with a peak output of 80 watts. The bass frequencies get 20 watts, with digital signal processing and the subwoofer working together for the massive low end.

 Similar to the [Razer Nommo speakers](https://common-error.techidaily.com/quick-remedies-to-address-missing-bluetooth-on-your-windows-11-system/), the Logitech Z407 uses a hockey puck-shaped dial to control various aspects of the speakers, though this dial is wireless. You can press and spin this dial to pause and resume playback, adjust volume, and adjust other aspects of the sound from as far as 65 feet away.

 One nice feature of the dial is adjusting the bass independently of the rest of the sound. This is handy if you've got roommates or live with family, as bass frequencies carry the most, and you don't want to wake up to a houseful of people at night.

 Logitech made an interesting choice with the main speakers in the Z407 in that they're dual-position. You can alternate between vertical and horizontal orientation, which makes it easier to fit them on nearly any sort of desk.

 Finally, the Z407 gives you plenty of options for connectivity, with a 3.5 mm jack being the sole analog option. For digital connections, you can choose between micro USB or Bluetooth connections.

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Massive but well-balanced sound                                          | ✗ Pricey                                                  |
| ✓ Plenty of power for small and medium-sized rooms                         | ✗ The included optical cable could've been longer         |
| ✓ Tons of connectivity options                                             | ✗ Quite bulky compared to average-sized computer speakers |
| ✓ Easy to use controls and a remote                                        |                                                           |
| ✓ The subfoower can deliver loads of clean and deep bass, when you need it |                                                           |

 If you’re in the market for a well-balanced 2.1 system for your computer setup and don’t mind paying a little extra check out the [Edifier S350DB](https://www.amazon.com/Edifier-Bookshelf-Subwoofer-Bluetooth-Wireless/dp/B077Y6PHKQ?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This massive pair of bookshelf speakers comes with a well-balanced sound and an 8-inch subwoofer that isn’t overpowering if you don’t want it to be. But if you want to feel the bass in your bones, just crank the bass output up and wait for a call from neighbors. 

 The two satellites pack dual drivers, are quite massive, and feature a vintage design that’s also reflected on the woofer. If you want a more neutral look, get the black version of the system, the [S351DB](https://www.amazon.com/Edifier-Bookshelf-Subwoofer-Bluetooth-Wireless/dp/B09VB389LD?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which should fit well with a broader range of room stylings than the wood grain finish of the S350DB. When it comes to controls, you’re getting easily accessed side-mounted knobs on the right satellite with which you can adjust the overall volume, bass, and treble. 

 You’re also getting a compact wireless control puck that includes all the important controls such as source selection, volume, play/pause rewind, and power. Aside from excellent controls, the S350GB comes with a ton of connectivity options that include Bluetooth with support for [aptX](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/easy-steps-to-recover-deleted-music-from-oppo-a58-4g-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/), AUX, RCA, [optical](https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-indispensable-top-vr-movie-adventures/), and coaxial. For the best sound, connect the speakers to your PC via the included optical cable, if possible. 

 As for the downsides, the two satellites, as well as the subwoofer, are quite massive. You should check the amount of free space you have on your desk before ordering these. Next, the included optical cable is a tad short, so you’ll have to get a longer one if you place the subwoofer too far from your PC. Also, while massive compared to most computer speaker systems, these aren’t the best choice for large rooms. Finally, to get the most out of the speakers, you should get [a pair of angled speaker stands](https://www.amazon.com/Bookshelf-Computer-Speakers-Vibration-Tabletop/dp/B08XQKVZNN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or use two pieces of foam or yoga blocks. 

 If you’re looking for something more affordable, the [Logitech Z625](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Z623-Watt-Speaker-System/dp/B01JPOLLKE?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 2.1 system is powerful, has lots of bass, and an optical connection. On the flip side, the overall sound quality is noticeably below that of the S350DB/S351DB. You could also check the [Klipsch ProMedia 2.1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000062VUO/ref=aod%5Frecs%5Fdesktop%5Fprsubs%5F2?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F806159%2Fbest-computer-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), a legendary budget 2.1 sound system that offers slightly poorer—but still impressive for the price it sells at—sound quality for considerably less money.
