##  What to Look For in a Turntable in 2023

 Generally speaking, if you've seen one turntable, you've seen them all. This makes it difficult to figure out what you should look for when buying one. Before you lay down any cash, be sure to check over the specs and make sure a turntable has the qualities you're looking for.

 First, materials are important. For turntables on the lower end of the price spectrum, you can expect an aluminum platter (which the record sits on) and tonearm (which holds the stylus on the record). You'll also find a few plastic parts on lower-end models.

 As you increase your budget, you'll see the materials change. Starting around $400 or $500, you'll begin to see carbon fiber tonearms and stainless-steel or acrylic platters.

 A turntable may feature a built-in preamp, especially budget to mid-range models. This is necessary to bring the volume up to a significant level that you can plug the turntable into an auxiliary input on a stereo. Higher-end turntables don't often have built-in preamps, as the manufacturers assume you'll either have one built into your stereo or use a standalone preamp.

 High-end turntables focus on just being turntables, but the lower end will typically feature extra connectivity. This could be a USB port, but more frequently lately this is Bluetooth, which lets you connect to wireless speakers and headphones.

 Finally, one more thing you may want to check is the availability of a replacement stylus (also known as a needle). These wear over time, so you'll want to have a few replacements on hand. If these are hard to get, you may want to choose a turntable you can more easily get replacement styluses for.

##  Best Turntable Overall: [Pro-Ject Debut Carbon EVO](https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Ject-Debut-Carbon-EVO-pre-Mounted/dp/B08FRL1KMH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207505&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F775597%2Fbest-turntable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Person listening to Pro-Ject turntable](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pro-ject-turntable.jpg) 

Pro-Ject

| Pros                               | Cons                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Fantastic features for the price | ✗ Need to replace the belt for 78 RPM playback |
| ✓ Carbon tonearm                   |                                                |
| ✓ Classy minimalist look           |                                                |

 For a balance of features, sound quality, and minimalist sheen, the [Pro-Ject Debut Carbon EVO](https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Ject-Debut-Carbon-EVO-pre-Mounted/dp/B08FRL1KMH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207505&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F775597%2Fbest-turntable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is our pick for the best turntable for most people. As sleek as it looks, many of the best features are things you won't notice at first.

 As the name implies, this turntable features an 8.6-inch carbon tonearm that combines a light touch with a rigid, stiff build. Combined with the [Sumiko Rainier phono cartridge](https://sumikophonocartridges.com/product/rainier-mm-phono-cartridge/), you get pristine, accurate sound quality. Even better, if you want to upgrade, you can easily mount a higher-quality cartridge like the [Sumiko Olympia](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crutchfield.com%2Fp_782OLYMPIA%2FSumiko-Olympia.html) in just a few seconds.

 Balance is everything for proper playback on a turntable, so the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon EVO has some nice suspension features. On the underside of the turntable, three adjustable TPE-damped feet help you get everything nice and level. The motor suspension underneath the steel platter resists vibrations, meaning a heavy footstep shouldn't alter the sound of your record.

 Also tucked neatly on the underside of the turntable is an electronic speed switch, letting you play different record formats easily. You can even play 78 RPM records by swapping in a different drive belt.

 Finally, in somewhat of a rarity for turntables, the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon EVO is available in multiple color options. You get relatively minimalist options like black and white, but there are also over-the-top options like High Gloss Red and Satin Golden Yellow.

 This turntable isn't our budget pick just for the sake of saving money, it's about getting the most bang for your buck. The [Fluance RT85 Reference High Fidelity Vinyl Turntable](https://www.amazon.com/Fluance-Reference-Turntable-Cartridge-Vibration/dp/B07KKK8ZB4?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207505&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F775597%2Fbest-turntable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is far from cheap, but it's an affordable option that you can buy once and not have to worry about for a long time.

 The Fluance RT85 uses a "less is more" approach to playing your records. To that end, you have a pure analog signal path from the record through the cartridge and all the way to the RCA jacks that carry the signal to your stereo. There are no extraneous electronics or digital components in the signal path.

 This pure approach leads to the acrylic platter as well. This material dampens unwanted vibrations and avoids resonant reverberations that could lead to unpleasant sound characteristics. Between the platter and the signal path, you get a much richer, three-dimensional soundstage.

 All of this rests on a solid wood plinth fixed with three rubber isolation feet. These prevent any vibrations from traveling through the feet into the plinth, while the plinth itself provides a steady foundation for the motor, platter, and tonearm.

 One thing to mention is that thanks to the approach this player takes, it doesn't include a preamp. You'll either need a stereo receiver with a phono in jack or a standalone preamp.

![Audio-Technica AT-LP60X-BK close-up](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Audio-Technica-AT-LP60X.jpg) 

| Pros                                | Cons                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ✓ Great sound quality for the price | ✗ Mostly plastic parts |
| ✓ Fully automatic playback controls |                        |
| ✓ Redesigned model is even better   |                        |

 Audio-Technica's AT-LP60 series has been around for years, offering quality performance at a price tag more casual vinyl fans are comfortable with. The [Audio-Technica AT-LP60X](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-AT-LP60X-BK-Belt-Drive-Hi-Fidelity-Anti-Resonance/dp/B07N3XJ66N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207505&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F775597%2Fbest-turntable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) refines a few components and simplifies the design, making for less noise and clearer sound in the process.

 One of the changes in this newest model is the tonearm. Audio-Technica redesigned the base and the headshell to improve how well the cartridge tracks the groove in the record. This new design also reduces resonance for a more accurate response.

 Another key change is that the AC/DC conversion has been moved out of the turntable itself and into an external adapter. This might make finding an outlet to plug the turntable in slightly more difficult, but it also keeps this noisy process better isolated from the turntable itself.

 Looking at features, the Audio-Technica AT-LP60X features dual speeds with a switch to select 33-1/3 RPM or 45 RPM. This turntable is also fully automatic, with a size selector to let the tonearm automatically start and finish playback. All you need to do is press the "Start" button.

 The Audio-Technica AT-LP60X is available in a variety of colors. For a more traditional look, you can choose Black or Gunmetal, while there are also flashier options available like Red and White.

While this type of turntable sees plenty of use among DJs, it's increasingly finding its way into high-end turntables. The motor here is quartz-controlled, making for excellent pitch stability.

 In addition to the motor, this model features a pre-installed moving coil cartridge, meaning the setup process is simpler than some other turntables. The tonearm was redesigned for the ALVA TT V2, minimizing resonant frequencies to ensure you hear every detail of every groove on the record.

 Many higher-end turntables opt not to include a preamp, assuming you'll want to choose your own. Cambridge Audio gives you both options with the ALVA TT V2, including a switchable preamp. This means you can turn it on with auxiliary inputs, then turn it off when using a standalone [preamp](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-samsung-galaxy-f14-5g-phone-password-without-factory-reset-full-guide-here-by-drfone-android/) or the phono inputs on your receiver.

 While a receiver or integrated amplifier is how most people still listen to records, we live in an increasingly wireless world. To that end, the ALVA TT V2 can connect to smart speakers and other devices using Bluetooth. The speaker uses aptX HD, so you get up to 24-bit/48kHz wireless audio.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Built in CD player, cassette deck, FM radio, and more      | ✗ Jack of all trades, master of none  |
| ✓ Bluetooth connectivity                                     | ✗ Turntable itself isn't the greatest |
| ✓ RCA jacks let it function as part of a larger audio system |                                       |
| ✓ Great retro look                                           |                                       |

 Victrola is a classic name in turntables, but more recently the company is best known for its retro styling but surprisingly modern features. The [Victrola 8-in-1 Bluetooth Record Player & Multimedia Center](https://www.amazon.com/Victrola-Navigator-Bluetooth-Encoding-Turntable/dp/B01GRYDTWI?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207505&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F775597%2Fbest-turntable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a perfect example of what the company does these days.

 As the name implies, this is much more than a record player. You also get a CD player, cassette player, FM radio, Bluetooth connectivity, line input, and a headphone output. If you're looking for an all-in-one music machine for a room or a second stereo, this is a great option.

 Looking at the turntable itself, this model supports three speeds: 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM. While you don't get a fancy tonearm or cartridge, you have some nice features. For example, thanks to the built-in USB audio interface, you can use this turntable to record vinyl records to your PC.

 While this is meant more as a standalone player rather than a component for your stereo, it has a pair of RCA jacks on the back that let you run it as a traditional turntable. This works for the radio, CD player, and cassette player as well, so this is a versatile player.

 This is a piece of decoration every bit as much as it's a gadget, so it makes sense that it comes in multiple finish options. There are numerous wood finishes like Espresso, Mahogany, and Oak, as well as painted finishes in Black and White.

This is essentially the same turntable as the [Audio-Technica AT-LP60X](https://some-tips.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-the-secrets-of-color-balance-in-gopro-videos/), except with Bluetooth built-in. Of course, this raises the price a bit, but not as much as you may expect.

 This model still includes RCA output jacks so you can connect it to a standard stereo system. Thanks to Bluetooth, you can now play your favorite records on a speaker outside or headphones on the other side of the room.

 The Bluetooth model has the same refinements to the tonearm, so you get the same increase in clarity and quality as the wired model. The stylus is the same as the Audio-Technica AT-LP60X, so you can easily find replacements when the time comes.

 As with the Audio-Technica AT-LP60X, the Bluetooth model comes in a variety of colors. You can choose from Black, White, and Red for the wireless model.

## FAQ

### How do you set up a turntable with speakers?

Most turntables use RCA connections for the output, which you can connect to an amplifier, receiver, or other device. If you have powered speakers, you can connect your turntable directly, but [passive speakers](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-building-brands-and-bonds-on-instagram-steps-to-reach-a-thousand-followers/) will need a receiver or [amplifier](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/understanding-the-cognitive-capabilities-of-android-technology/).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Do I need a receiver for my turntable?

You don't necessarily need a receiver for your turntable. While this is the most common way of using a turntable, you can also connect your turntable to an [integrated amplifier](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unveil-your-world-in-wide-angle-iosandroid-photo-integration-on-social-media/), [headphone amplifier](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-creating-a-bootable-windows-11-installation-drive-from-an-iso-file/), or powered speakers.

### How do you clean a turntable needle?

There are kits available for cleaning the stylus (needle) of your turntable. These often include a soft brush as well as a cleaning solution. This is a better option than using household items, as these could potentially damage your stylus.

### What is a turntable preamp?

Turntables have a lower output signal than CD players or other audio devices. The phono input on receivers and amplifiers boosts the signal to account for this. If your receiver or amplifier doesn't have a phono input, a preamp will boost the signal enough to use with an auxiliary or other input.
