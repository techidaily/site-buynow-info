 If you shared Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming passwords with friends and family, you may want to rein in who has access to your accounts. Thankfully, it's easy to see which devices are accessing your streaming apps. We'll help you sniff out the lurkers and remove them if you wish to do so.

##  Why It's Important to See Who's Using Your Account

 You may not want your ex-partner, a long-lost college roommate, or a bunch of other people you don't even talk to anymore using your accounts. This is especially important for platforms like Netflix—[Netflix does _not_ like you sharing your account](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/screen-recorder-alternatives-in-depth-review-and-top-picks-for-2024/) with the whole village. If you want to share your account, you can always [add an extra member on Netflix](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-tenfold-video-recording-tricks-on-your-windows-11-system/).

 Fortunately, there's a way to see who's logged into your account on most platforms. We'll explain how to do this on some popular platforms, including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Spotify, Disney+, Max, YouTube, YouTube TV, YouTube Music, Apple TV+, and Apple Music. If your platform isn't listed, you can probably find a similar option somewhere in the settings section.

##  How to See Who's Using Your Netflix Account

 To see who's using your Netflix account on the web, log in, hover your cursor over your profile avatar at the top-left of the screen, and select "Account & Settings." Navigate to the "Your Devices" tab to see the list of devices that recently logged into your Netflix account. If you want to revoke access to any accounts, click "Sign Out" on those accounts. When you're done, change the password.

![Netflix devices via the web version.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/netflix-devices-1.jpg) 

 If you're using Netflix on your phone, tap on your profile avatar at the bottom right. Select the cog icon from the top right. Select "Registered Devices," then select the device you want to sign out of and change the password.

##  How to See Who's Using Your Amazon Prime Video Account

 To see who's using your Amazon Prime Video account on the web, go to Prime Video, log in, and hover your cursor over your profile name. Click on "Account & Settings" and switch to the "Your Devices" tab. You should now see a list of devices logged in to your account.

![List of devices seen using the web version.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prime-devices.jpg) 

 However, you'll see all the devices if you're the primary owner of an account. If you're not the primary owner, which means you're using a family member or friend's account, you'll only see your devices. You can remove a device from the list by clicking the "Deregister" option on the right of the device.

 If you're using the mobile app, tap on your profile avatar from the top-right of your screen. Select the cog icon placed at the top-right. Tap on "Registered devices."

![List of devices viewed using the Amazon Prime Video phone app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prime-devices-phone.jpg) 

##  How to See Who’s Using Your Hulu Account

 To see who's using your Hulu account via the web, open Hulu and log in. Hover your cursor over your profile name at the top-right of the screen. Select Account > Manage devices.

 You'll see a list of devices currently logged into your Hulu account. If you want to remove a device, click "Remove."

![Hulu logged in devices.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/9.jpg) 

 There's currently no way to see logged-in devices using Hulu's mobile app.

##  How to See Who's Using Your Spotify Account

 When using [Spotify](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-navigate-your-way-to-the-best-idevice-apps-for-extracting-content-from-facebook/) in your browser, log in and click your account name at the top-right. Select "Account." Click the "Sign Out Everywhere" button and confirm when prompted. Doing this logs you out on mobile phones, tablets, the web, and desktops. However, doing this has no impact on smart speakers, gaming consoles, or TVs.

 To log out of these devices, head over to "Apps" using the left sidebar. Click "Remove Access" for any app or device you want to log out of your Spotify account.

![Spotify devices list accessed via the web version.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/spotify-devices.jpg)

 Unfortunately, none of these options are available on the phone app at the time of writing.

##  How to See Who's Using Your Disney+ Account

 When using Disney+ on the web, log into your account, hover your cursor over the profile avatar at the top-right of the screen, and select "Account." There's a "Log out of all devices" option here.

![Disney Plus log out of all devices.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-03-07_10-47-43.png)

 While that's not the same as being able to see a list of devices logged into your account like on other platforms, it does allow you to regain control of your account. You can always share the new password if you want to share access with someone. The process is exactly the same for the Disney+ mobile app.

##  How to See Who's Using Your HBO Max Account

 To see who's using your [Max](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/in-2024-updated-insights-sonys-s3700-blu-ray-box-player/) account (formerly HBO Max), start by logging into your account via a web browser. Select "Settings," scroll down to find the "Devices" section, and select "Manage Devices." Here, you'll see a list of devices that recently logged into your account, as well as the timestamp indicating the last use.

![HBO Max manage devices.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/auth-max-com_account_devices-ipad-air.png) 

 If you want to remove any of these devices, click on the X icon next to the device you want to remove. Alternatively, you can choose to "Sign All Devices Out" to remove all devices, including the device you're currently using.

 The process is exactly the same for the phone app. Just like on the web, you can remove a device using the phone app by clicking the X icon next to the device's name, or you can choose to sign out of all devices.

##  How to See Who's Using Your YouTube, YouTube TV, and YouTube Music Account

 Since YouTube, YouTube TV, and YouTube Music are part of the Google ecosystem, you can control the devices logged into these accounts via your Google account.

 To see who's using your YouTube account on the web, go to your [Google Account page](https://myaccount.google.com/). Switch to the "Security" tab, scroll down until you find the "Your Devices" section, and click on "Manage All Devices." Select a device and then click on "Sign Out" to sign out of a YouTube account on that device.

![List of devices logged into your Google account accessed via the web version.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-devices.png) 

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Remember that when you remove a device from this list, the device will be signed out of the Google account. This means the device will have to log in again to use Gmail, Google Workspace, and, of course, YouTube. Unlike other platforms, there's no option to sign out of all devices at once.

 If you're using the phone app, launch the Google app (not YouTube) and tap your profile avatar at the top-right. Tap "Google Account," switch to the "Security" tab, and scroll down to the "Your Devices" section. Tap "Manage All Devices." Select a device you want to log out of and tap the "Sign Out" button.

##  How to See Who's Using Your Apple TV+ and Apple Music Account

 Like with Google, Apple streaming services are managed centrally via your Apple account. To see who's using your Apple TV+ and Apple Music account, log into your Apple account from the [Apple ID page](https://appleid.apple.com/). Select "Devices" from the left sidebar, then select a device to remove from the list and click "Remove From Account."

 Alternatively, select "System Settings" from the Apple menu on a Mac and choose your name or Apple ID. Scroll down to the "Devices" section and search for the device you want to remove in the left sidebar. Select "Remove from Account."

##  Regain Control Over Your Accounts

 Someone with access to your account might just change the password themselves. Sure, that's not a big problem when you're sharing a password with a friend, but platforms like Netflix are increasingly trying to put an end to account sharing.

 As per Netflix's current policy, you can only share your password with a member of your household. If you shared your Netflix password with someone back in the day, now's a good time to revoke their access. The same applies to other platforms as well.
