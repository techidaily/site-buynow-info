##  What to Look For in an LED Strip Light in 2024

 LED strip lights are available in a wide variety of options geared to suit nearly any lighting application. So, with that many choices, how do you know what to look for? You'll want to decide a color type, how bright you need your strips to be, and any additional features you might need.

 When determining a color type, know there are generally three main options for smart LED strips: daylight white, warm white, and [RGB](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-brand-collaboration-on-youtube/). In working spaces or other areas requiring focus or attention, daylight white is the best choice. Warm white is the way to go in rooms geared more toward relaxation. RGB would be the best choice for any scenario that could use some mood lighting---say, behind a bar, computer monitor, or sound system.

 After making that decision, you'll want to determine your brightness requirements. If you need high brightness for your home, make sure that you choose 5050 LED lights. Other lumen options, including 3528 or 2835 LED, are generally used to accent or create the desired ambiance and are generally not as bright.

 Finally, it's important to consider any other special features your lighting project might require. For example, a waterproof light strip is the safest bet if your application is outdoors or might encounter any moisture. If you want your strip lights and [smart bulbs](https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-achieve-creative-excellence-on-tiktok-with-easy-border-swapping-strategies-for-2024/) to sync up, it's usually best to grab items from the same company. It's also important to ensure any smart features work with your smart home ecosystem, whether it's Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple HomeKit.

 With that in mind, here are our picks for the best LED strip lights.

 Govee consistently produces lighting technology that's as innovative as it is durable, so it's no surprise that its [65.6-foot Smart LED Strip Lights](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Wireless-Control-Kitchen-Million/dp/B098JD9JGR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209335&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F742041%2Fbest-led-strip-light%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) are the best option for most people. With two 32.8-foot rolls of lights, you can easily brighten up multiple rooms or cabinets with vivid colors or ambient whites.

 These strip lights are made with 600 LEDs, brighter than the average competition, and it's easy to customize the light or color temperature of the LED strips through Govee's app, available for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU209335/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.govee.home&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) and [iOS](http://apps.apple.com/us/app/govee-home/id1395696823). In the app, you can also play around with over 64 dynamic light scene modes, turn lights on and off, and set up automated schedules.

 Govee's Smart LED light strips are compatible with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can adjust brightness, change colors, and turn lights on and off with simple voice commands. These lights can also sync up to music playing from your phone, creating a unique light show that's great for parties.

 The only downside to these lights is their price, which is higher than the competition. That said, many people who invest in Govee lights don't need to replace them for quite some time, whereas cheaper options won't last as long or end up with a few random LEDs on the strip that won't turn on.

| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |

| ✓ Compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant | ✗ App isn't user-friendly |

 Want to harness the full potential of Govee's strip lights but for a fraction of the cost? Enter [TJoy's Smart LED Light Strip](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G92D3NG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209335&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F742041%2Fbest-led-strip-light%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). TJoy's strip lights offer many of the same features that Govee does, such as voice and smartphone control (including Google Assistant and Alexa) and light syncing to your favorite music.

 You'll also get 16 million color combinations with brightness control through TJoy's Tuya app (available on [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU209335/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tuya.smart&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) and [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tuyasmart/id1034649547)), which is the same number of colors as Govee's app offers. If you don't want to deal with the app, though, you can also use a remote control to adjust the lights as needed.

 The LEDs on TJoy's smart LED strip are bright and vivid, though you only get 50ft of LED lights as opposed to Govee's 65.6ft. This doesn't matter much if you're setting up for a smaller space and needed to cut the strip anyway but it might be a dealbreaker if you're looking to deck out bigger rooms.

 That being said, [some users report issues](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EBOUJS1E?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209335&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F742041%2Fbest-led-strip-light%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) with setting the TJoy strip up by using the app, but it seems like persistence and patience usually get the job done. If you're not particularly tech-savvy, though, you may want to investigate other options.

 If your lighting project runs the risk of being near water or moisture, you can't do any better than [Hitlights' Waterproof Warm White LED Light Strips](https://www.amazon.com/Waterproof-White-Light-Premium-Density/dp/B00CMX2KGK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209335&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F742041%2Fbest-led-strip-light%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Besides housing superior quality 3528 LEDs that provide smooth and even light output, these strips boast an impressive [IP-67 waterproof rating](https://www.reviewgeek.com/62529/ip-ratings-explained-what-does-the-code-mean-for-your-devices/).

 The IP rating means these Hitlights strips have been tested to work for at least 30 minutes while under 3 feet of water. This LED strip can withstand a lot when it comes to typical water exposure. Most other "waterproof" strip lights don't even come close to this kind of rating. So, put them anywhere and relax—these lights can handle it.

 Granted, these strips do not have any smart functions, nor any RGB colors. This is just a single-color strip. In addition, if you need to cut the strip, the area needs to be resealed to keep the waterproofing intact. But if a waterproof LED strip is your main priority, you cannot beat these warm white light strips.

| ✓ Works best with Alexa voice control | ✗ Cut points are widely spaced |

 For all those Amazon Alexa users out there, the [Cozylady Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/Cozylady-LED-Strip-Lights-65-6FT/dp/B088D5B7QD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209335&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F742041%2Fbest-led-strip-light%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) might be your new favorite component to your smart home. You can control everything with Alexa voice commands, such as turning the lights on and off, adjusting brightness, and moving between various light modes. You can also do all this within the Happy Lighting app, available on [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/happylighting-life-with-smart/id1145694075), [iPad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/happylighting-life-with-smart/id1145694075), and [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU209335/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaoyu.hlight&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US).

 In older reviews, [some users complained](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BFTI1HZB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209335&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F742041%2Fbest-led-strip-light%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) that the adhesive that holds the Cozylady strips up has been insufficient, but the company claims it has replaced the adhesive with one that gets thicker and stronger over time. Cozylady also says that it's happy to send out additional adhesive tape if needed, so if you happen to get a defective adhesive unit, you can get a replacement with minimal fuss.

 One disadvantage of the Cozylady strips, however, is that they can only be cut at widely spaced intervals, so precise placement can get a little tricky. Also, users report that to control the lights with the included remote, a direct line-of-sight with the receiver on the light strip must be maintained. This isn't uncommon with budget strip lights, but frustrating if you want to keep the receiver hidden.

 Still, Alexa integration is highly praised, so if you want to control your lights with an Amazon device, Cozylady's LED strip lights make a solid choice.

| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ✓ Simple pairing via Bluetooth                | ✗ Expensive compared to competition |

| ✓ Ties into a Hue Hub for added functionality |                                     |

 If you can look past its price tag, the [Philips Hue Lightstrip](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-Lightstrip-Compatible/dp/B08CKJWSFS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209335&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F742041%2Fbest-led-strip-light%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has a lot to offer. If you're looking for a great product that will integrate natively with Google Assistant, you can't do much better than this. The light strip can be easily connected to your smart home using Bluetooth and can be synced with gaming, music, and movies using the intuitive [Hue Sync](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU209335/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/explore-hue/propositions/entertainment/sync-with-pc) app.

 Aside from easy Google Home integration, Philips Hue Lightstrips are surprisingly easy to install. Each pack comes with six feet of lights and more can be connected if needed, with up to 32 feet per base kit. They also come with cutmark indicators that make it easy to trim off the excess for smaller applications.

 Best of all, Philips has incorporated a unique coating around the entire light strip that offers uniform illumination, meaning you shouldn't get any "dark spots" in between lights.

 While you can enjoy Philips Hue Lightstrips with a simple Bluetooth connection, you'll need to add a [Hue Hub](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Stand-Alone-Bridge/dp/B016H0QZ7I?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209335&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F742041%2Fbest-led-strip-light%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to experience everything they have to offer. This includes automated schedules, the ability to sync with movies, and the option to toggle lights on or off when entering and leaving your home.

 The only real drawback to the Hue Lightstrip is its price, which is considerably more expensive than the competition. It's not a dealbreaker, but the addition of a Hue Hub--which typically costs more than $50---could end up putting you over budget if you need that additional functionality.

 Nanoleaf's Essentials Lightstrip works well for Apple HomeKit users, and it's Matter-enabled, so it'll help futureproof your home in case you ever change smart home ecosystems. Setup is incredibly simple, and you can customize and control the light strip via the Nanoleaf app, available for both [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU209335/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.nanoleaf.nanoleaf) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nanoleaf/id1049333656).

 Through the app, you can choose your favorite color among over 16 million options, switch between cool white and warm white, or play around with color-changing animations, like Fade, Highlight, or Random. You can also automate the lights to turn on and off at set times, which can help you wake up or fall asleep on time if the lights are in your bedroom.

 The Nanoleaf Essentials Lightstrip is compatible with the Apple Home app, Google Home app, or any other Matter-compatible app, as well as any voice assistants used for these smart home ecosystems. It's also worth noting that this strip [doesn't support Apple's Adaptive Lighting feature](https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx3OIPBOYX0MQQ1/ref=ask%5Fdp%5Flsw%5Fal%5Fhza?asin=B0C1JB8ZPT&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209335&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F742041%2Fbest-led-strip-light%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for HomeKit, and future support is dependent on Apple's timeline.
