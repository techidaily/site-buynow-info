##  What to Look For in a Robot Mop in 2023

 Robot vacuums might be more popular, but robot mops have quickly become a staple of today's smart homes. Allowing you to clean your laminate, vinyl, hardwood, or tile floors without lifting a finger, the appeal of robot mops is obvious.

 However, finding the best robot mop for your home isn't an easy task. To help narrow down all the options, the first thing you'll need to do is set a budget. These products carry a wide range of price tags, dipping as low as a few hundred bucks to well over $1,000—and if you don't set a budget ahead of time, you could spend more than you intend.

 Once you've set a budget, the fun can officially begin. This is where you'll go down a list of features you'd like to see in your robot companion. Do you want your mop to double as a vacuum? Do you need your robot mop to sync with the rest of your smart home? How much battery life do you need for a single cleaning? And what sort of functionality do you want with your mop's accompanying smartphone app? Typically, the more you're willing to spend, the more features you'll get.

 These are just a few of the questions you'll need to answer before making a purchase. At the bare minimum, we'd recommend determining if you want your mop to double as a vacuum and figuring out if you need smart home compatibility.

 You'll also want to ensure that the mop you're picking up offers reliable mopping skills, as far too often mopping features take a backseat to vacuum prowess. Anything with moving mopheads typically works better than stationary pads, as they can scrub out tenacious debris that would otherwise stay stuck to your floors.

 If you need help sift through the ocean of products, we've compiled a short list of the five best robot mops. Whether you need something made specifically for pets, are shopping on a budget, or want the best robot mop money can buy, one of these highly-reviewed gadgets is bound to fit your needs.

| Pros                           | Cons                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Spinning mopheads            | ✗ Expensive                                   |
| ✓ Detects and avoids carpet    | ✗ Must manually swap out vacuum and mop units |
| ✓ Up to 100 minutes of runtime |                                               |

 The [Bissell SpinWave](https://www.amazon.com/SpinWave-Connected-Structured-Navigation-3115/dp/B08F6Z89LN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203840&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F843569%2Fbest-robot-mops%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) packs many cool features, but nothing is as notable as its rotating mopheads. Unlike most robot mops that drag their pads across the floor, SpinWave's two mopheads actively rotate to offer a deeper and more complete cleaning experience.

 If you have carpet and hardwood floors in your home, you'll be glad to know that the Bissell SpinWave also serves as a vacuum. You'll need to swap out components to switch from mopping to vacuuming, but it's nice to have the functionality if needed.

 You won't have to worry about the SpinWave accidentally mopping your carpet either, as Bissell has incorporated a soft surface avoidance sensor that prevents the robot from stumbling onto your carpet while mopping.

 Rounding out the impressive robot mop is a 100-minute battery life, a robust [smartphone app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU203840/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bissell.bissellconnect) that lets you schedule different cleaning sessions, and a spinning edge brush to clean those hard-to-reach locations. If you don't mind the price tag, there's no reason to pass up the Bissell SpinWave.

 Tikom makes a small range of powerful cordless vacuum cleaners and robot mops, including combos like the [Tikom L9000 Vacuum and Mop Combo](https://www.amazon.com/Tikom-L9000-Navigation-Robotic-Cleaner/dp/B0CH11WZG3/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203840&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F843569%2Fbest-robot-mops%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Not only will the Tikom L9000 not break the bank, but it will also give costlier robot mops a run for their money. 

 Designed to both mop and sweep, the L9000 is a cost-effective way to automate your cleaning, which it does with style, thanks to its many helpful features.

 Pets are adorable, but cleaning up their fur can be pesky. If you want an automated way to keep your houseand pet areas clean, then the [Yeedi Cube Robot Vacuum and Mop](https://www.amazon.com/Yeedi-ECOVACS-Emptying-Obstacle-Climbing/dp/B0C49W7DPP/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203840&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F843569%2Fbest-robot-mops%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) by ECOVACS is the way to go. Like the Tikom L900, the Yeedi Cube is a vacuum and mop combo that sweeps and cleans with a built-in back-and-forth scrubber and two side brushes.

 The Yeedi Cube has a huge 1,000ml water tank and a 360ml dustbin, allowing it to clean for longer than most other robot mops. And when its water tank runs low and the dustbin is full, it returns to the base station to empty itself. When the Cube is done cleaning, it washes and self-dries the mop with hot air of up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, preventing odor and humidity. 

 It packs a powerful suction force that allows it to vacuum and mop a variety of surfaces, including hardwood floors, tile, and marble. We tested the robot mop's ability to clean in our [Yeedi Cube review](https://change-location.techidaily.com/guide-how-to-unbrick-a-bricked-infinix-note-30-pro-phone-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), and came away pleased:

 During my tests, I placed orange juice and soda on my kitchen floor, as well as solids like pieces of dog food and pretzels. The Yeedi Cube didn't miss any of these items and either sucked or cleaned them away after just a few passes. For my carpet-only tests, I scattered around pretzel pieces and dog hair.

 Powered by a huge 5,200mAh battery, it can run for nearly 150 minutes before recharging. This allows you to clean for longer on a single charge. It also comes with smart features like smart mopping and obstacle avoidance.

 The Yeedi app on [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU203840/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yeedi.app&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US&pli=1) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yeedi/id1509407909) lets you control other functions of the Yeedi Cube including mapping, scheduling, splitting rooms, and no-go zones. You can also control it using Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri; it will perform the assigned task and promptly return to the base station. With these features and more, the Yeedi Cube is fully equipped to help you eliminate annoying pet hair and other debris.

| --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| ✓ Powerful software               | ✗ No vacuum capabilities |

 The [iRobot Braava Jet M6](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QNM91NQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203840&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F843569%2Fbest-robot-mops%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is essentially the big brother of the iRobot Braava Jet 240\. It offers a similar, exceptional cleaning experience, but this time with enhanced smart home chops and an improved design.

 Like its more affordable sibling, the Braava Jet M6 knows which cleaning mode to select based solely on which mopping pad you install. You can also set up specific rooms for it to clean or create restricted zones for it to ignore, allowing you to design a cleaning cycle that's optimized for your home. Better yet, the Jet M6 can suggest extra cleanings if it notices your house is dirtier than usual.

 If you're protective of your hardwood floors, you can add either the [Bona Hardwood Floor Cleaner](https://www.amazon.com/Bona%C2%AE-Hardwood-Floor-Cleaner-Refill/dp/B000ARPVIY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203840&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F843569%2Fbest-robot-mops%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [Braava Jet Hard Surface Cleaning Solution](https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Authentic-Replacement-Parts-Compatible/dp/B0B5W23QQ8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203840&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F843569%2Fbest-robot-mops%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to Jet M6---both of which are fully supported by the robot. Neither solution will cause any damage to the device or clog up its internal tubing.

 The Braava Jet M6 is undoubtedly a premium robot mop, but it, unfortunately, also features a premium price tag. It also lacks any vacuuming capabilities, so you'll need to pick up another robot if you have carpet in your home. Aside from those small drawbacks, there's not much to dislike about this impressive robot mop.

| Pros                                                  | Cons        |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| ✓ Can go from mopping to vacuuming without user input | ✗ Expensive |
| ✓ Advanced detection and avoidance system             |             |
| ✓ Docking station holds two months of waste           |             |

 As one of the newest robots on this list, it should be no surprise that the [iRobot Roomba Combo j7+](https://www.amazon.com/iRobot%C2%AE-Roomba-ComboTM-Self-Emptying-Vacuum/dp/B0BCH3J9RD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203840&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F843569%2Fbest-robot-mops%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) boasts some high-tech features. Its big claim to fame is the ability to go from mopping to vacuuming without any human intervention, thanks to a mophead that automatically lifts off the ground when venturing onto the carpet.

 It's an impressive skill and one that's lacking in every other product mentioned above. However, you'll pay for the functionality, with the j7+ clocking in at over $1,000\. You're getting more than a movable mophead for your money, as this Roomba product features impressive mapping and navigation skills, support for Alexa, and a charging dock that can hold up to two months of dust before needing to be emptied.

 Since the Roomba Combo j7+ can mop, vacuum, and empty itself without any manual intervention, it's one of the most autonomous robot mops on the market. Its single mophead may not clean as well as the Bissell SpinWave (and its price tag might make your eyes water), but anyone trying to truly automate their cleaning can't go wrong with the latest product from Roomba.

### Can you use a robot mop on vinyl plank flooring?

 Yes. Robot mops can clean vinyl plank flooring without any issues. Some perform better than others, so be sure to check out each model for details on their cleaning prowess.

### Can you put floor cleaner in a robot mop?

 This depends on your model. Be sure to consult your owner's manual before adding any sort of liquid to your robot mop. Typically, you'll only want to use the cleaning solution that came with your device---and if it didn't come with anything, then water is likely your best (and only) option.
