##  What to Look For in a PS5 Headset in 2023

 Searching for a reliable PS5 headset can be a challenge. Not only are there endless options in today's market, but companies often use exclusive marketing jargon you won't see on other brands, making comparisons difficult.

 For example, two headsets that offer 40mm drivers might sound radically different from each other, and headsets that offer [active noise cancellation (ANC)](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-sharing-twitch-on-your-fb-page-for-2024/) might have different performances in the real world. But when finding a great PS5 headset, there are a few things to keep in mind.

 The first feature you'll want to look for is [3D Audio](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-your-guide-to-the-funniest-and-most-touching-memes-on-instagram-for-2024/) (sometimes called Tempest 3D Audio). This is a new technology that's unique to PS5, and not all headsets are compatible with its high-end requirements.

 If a prospective headset doesn't offer 3D Audio support, it's not necessarily a dealbreaker, although you'll need to dig deeper to ensure it'll pump out clear sounds. If it does offer 3D Audio support, there's a strong chance it'll live up to your standards.

 Another easy way to find a headset is to stick with well-known manufacturers. It's hard to go wrong with anything from Bose, SteelSeries, or Turtle Beach, and even Sony is known to make premium headsets.

 Once you've found a brand that fits your needs, you'll need to zero in on which features are most important. Wireless headsets allow you to move around without cables, although they'll be more expensive than their wired counterparts. Headsets that boast ANC typically cost more than passive noise cancellation. If you're going to be using your headset to communicate with online teammates, a good microphone is also essential.

 We've scoured the web to find the best PS5 headsets available, many of which pose a good combination of performance and price tag. Regardless of what you seek from a headset, one of these five should fit the bill.

| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ✓ First-party hardware | ✗ Lackluster microphone |

| ✓ 3D Audio support     |                         |

 While there are dozens of great headsets on the market, it's difficult to beat the combination of value and performance offered by [Sony's Pulse 3D Headset](https://www.amazon.com/PULSE-3D-Wireless-Headset-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6QLKN?tag=htg-v2-780aptu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206696&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789499%2Fbest-ps5-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Clocking in at less than $100, few products in this price range manage to take full advantage of the PlayStation 5's 3D Audio technology and look this good doing it.

 Offered in either [White](https://www.amazon.com/PULSE-3D-Wireless-Headset-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6QLKN?tag=htg-v2-780aptu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206696&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789499%2Fbest-ps5-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [Midnight Black](https://www.amazon.com/PULSE-3D-Wireless-Headset-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6QLKN?tag=htg-v2-780aptu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206696&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789499%2Fbest-ps5-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), both designs complement your PS5 console and look right at home sitting on your entertainment center.

 Hiding behind the Pulse 3D headset's good looks is a suite of impressive hardware, including dual hidden microphones for voice chat, built-in volume controls, and support for both wireless connectivity and wired connections using a 3.5mm audio jack.

 While most people will find the Pulse 3D headset to pump out impressive sound, its hidden mics might leave something to be desired. The lack of a boom mic gives the Pulse 3D a sleek profile, but its pinhole microphone doesn't quite hold up to the competition. If you need to be heard clearly and consistently, you might need [another headset](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-unlicensed-legal-tracks-downloads-for-gaming/).

 Minor complaints aside, Sony's first-party headset is an easy recommendation for just about every PS5 owner.

| Pros                                         | Cons                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ✓ Less than $60                              | ✗ Wired connection            |
| ✓ 3.5mm jack compatible with other platforms | ✗ Slightly uninspiring design |
| ✓ Lightweight and comfortable                |                               |

 Buying a gaming headset on a tight budget is always likely to involve some compromises, including going without advanced and costly features such as Active Noise Canceling. But that doesn't mean you can't still experience great gaming audio.

 Available for around $50, the [Arctis Nova 1](https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0B8Q4CR52/?tag=htg-v2-780aptu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206696&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789499%2Fbest-ps5-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) headset from SteelSeries provides a lot of premium-feature bang for a relatively low buck. These include 40mm High-Fidelity drivers, 360-degree spatial audio, and a fully retractable bidirectional noise-canceling microphone. 

 The headset weighs in at a pleasingly light 263 grams, so you won't have to worry about getting neck aches during those all-day gaming sessions. Although not the most adjustable headset we've ever seen, features like the floating headband and AirWeave memory foam earcups should make finding a comfortable wearing position easy for most users. 

 The Nova 1 works perfectly with the PS5 and is fully compatible with [Sony Tempest 3D Audio](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-your-guide-to-the-funniest-and-most-touching-memes-on-instagram-for-2024/). The 3.5mm audio jack means it can also be used with almost any other gaming platform, so you don't have to invest in additional headsets if you play in multiple ways. 

 If you can overlook the slightly uninspired design and don't mind being tethered to your PS5 by a wire, the Arctis Nova 1 is pretty hard to beat for the money.

Best Budget PS5 Headset

#####  SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1

SteelSeries is well-known for producing excellent gaming peripherals, and the Arctis Nova 1 headset is no exception. While it sits firmly at the budget end in terms of pricing, it doesn't scrimp on audio quality, comfort, and gaming QOL features.

| Pros                              | Cons        |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| ✓ Designed specifically for PS5   | ✗ Expensive |
| ✓ Supports Tempest 3D Audio       |             |
| ✓ Sleek PS5-inspired color scheme |             |

 While it's more expensive than the [Arctis 1](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/instagram-tracking-essentials-choosing-the-best-data-visualization-apps/), the [Arctis 7P](https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09KMGHPCY?tag=htg-v2-780aptu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206696&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789499%2Fbest-ps5-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is SteelSeries at its best. Premium components, retractable boom mic, and 30-hour battery life make the headset one of the best on the market---but its highly rated sound quality is the main reason for its popularity.

 Built from the ground up for 3D Audio support, even the most discerning listener will be impressed with the Arctis 7P. That performance is paired with a sleek design (featuring the same color scheme as the PS5 console) and steel-reinforced construction.

 SteelSeries' high-end headset has won numerous awards, so it should come as no surprise that it continues to be one of the best wireless headsets on the market.

 There are a few drawbacks to the Arctis 7P, however. Its unique, retractable microphone tends to move around while in use and can sometimes send muffled audio to teammates. It's not a dealbreaker (and most users will find it to be a non-issue), but with a price tag over $150, it's something to keep in mind.

It's not tailored specifically to children (few reliable headsets are), but its low price tag and adjustable design make it a great option.

 While parents will love its cost, kids will love the wide assortment of color schemes available on the Recon 70\. Eight different designs are currently offered, ranging from standard [Black](https://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Gaming-Headset-PlayStation-Nintendo-4/dp/B07NH6Q4LB?tag=htg-v2-780aptu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206696&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789499%2Fbest-ps5-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to [White and Neon Green](https://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Gaming-Headset-PlayStation-Nintendo-4/dp/B07NQXBZM9?tag=htg-v2-780aptu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206696&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789499%2Fbest-ps5-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Regardless of which color you choose, you'll get full compatibility for PS5 and other platforms with a 3.5mm audio jack, a microphone that flips up when not in use, and 40mm drivers that pump out crisp sound.

 Its drivers can't compete with the [more expensive options](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-exploring-8-superior-youtube-to-avi-software/) on our list, but for kids, it'll be more than serviceable. And if you're afraid they'll get damaged shortly after being purchased, you can always find used versions for around $20, making it easy to find a replacement.

 Razer has built a strong reputation for making high-quality gaming peripherals over its 25-year history, and products like the [Razer Barracuda Pro Wireless Headset](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Barracuda-Wireless-Headset-PlayStation/dp/B09Z1KLJ7L/?tag=htg-v2-780aptu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206696&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789499%2Fbest-ps5-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) prove that the company still knows what makes a great headset. 

 Featuring 50mm TriForce Bio-cellulose drivers and a built-in THX AAA amplifier, the Barracuda Pro headset is certainly no slouch regarding audio fidelity. Audio settings can be tweaked to your liking through the Razer app for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/razer-audio/id1525531841) or [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU206696/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.razer.audiocompanion), including activating the hybrid ANC when you need to shut out the real world and get fully immersed in your game. 

 Aside from audio quality, one of the most important considerations when buying a wireless headset is battery life. And while the Barracuda Pro headset doesn't offer hot-swappable batteries included with some higher-priced devices, it does provide 40 hours of use from a full charge. That should be plenty enough for several days of gaming on your PS5\. 

 Connectivity is provided by both 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth, allowing you to switch between gaming and taking a call on your phone simply by tapping the SmartSwitch button on the headset. It's a clever feature and one that is fully customizable in the Razer app. 

 The design of the headset is very low-key. There isn't even a boom for the mic, with your voice instead captured by the dual [beamforming](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-passcode-from-iphone-14-pro-max-complete-guide-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) microphones built into the front of the ear cups. That makes the Barracuda Pro headset just as suited to listening to music from your phone or laptop as to letting you hear every footstep and bullet ricochet in your favorite video game. 

 At $249, the Razer Barracuda Pro isn't a cheap option, but there are very few of those around when choosing an ANC gaming headset. And considering the brand pedigree, high build quality, and premium audio features, this headset is pretty easy to recommend.
