 Twitch allows streamers to automatically save a copy of their broadcast to the cloud. They also provide a quick way to download your videos so you can store them on your PC or upload them elsewhere. Here's everything you need to know about downloading one of Twitch's Videos on Demand (VOD). 

##  Enable Twitch VODs on Your Account

 Twitch will not save VODs by default, you must manually enable that option first. Log in to Twitch, click your user icon in the upper right corner, then select “Creator Dashboard.”

![Select your profile icon in the upper right corner, then select 'Creator Dashboard.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/4-1.png) 

 Click the “Settings” option in the left pane, then select “Stream.” Scroll down until you see the VOD Settings section.

 Click the toggle next to “Store Past Broadcasts.” You can also choose if you want VODs to automatically be published.

 Now, Twitch will automatically generate a VOD every time you stream. VODs will be available online for at least 7 days. If you’re an affiliate, they’ll be available for 14 days, while Partners, Turbo and Prime users all have 60 days. They’re gone once that window closes, however. If you want to back them up, you should do it as soon as possible after your initial stream.

 In general, it is better to record your stream directly to your PC while you're broadcasting if you can, rather than downloading it after the fact. You can [use NVIDIA Shadowplay to record](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-boost-love-odds-expert-tips-for-compelling-tinder-profiles/) your screen, but [Open Broadcast Software (OBS) allows you to stream](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-behind-the-scenes-of-lol-top-3-broadcast-techniques/) _and_ record using one program. 

##  Download Your Twitch VODs

 To download one of your Twitch videos, click on your profile picture in the top right corner of the Twitch home page and select “Video Producer.”

![Click your profile icon in the upper right, then select 'Video Producer.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1-1.png) 

 Once you’re on the Video Producer page, click the three vertical dots next to the video you’d like to save and select “Download.”

![Click the three dots next to the video you want to download, then select 'Download' from the menu.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3-1.png) 

##  Download Someone Else’s Twitch VODs

 There is no official way to download someone else’s videos from Twitch. If you do decide to do it, you’ll need a browser extension or to use a website that provides that service. 

 However, you should be aware that using such tools likely violates [Twitch's terms of service](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/) and _could_ land you in hot water. You should also [be careful which browser extension you use](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-selective-soundscape-picks-for-video-editors/)—they're not all trustworthy.
